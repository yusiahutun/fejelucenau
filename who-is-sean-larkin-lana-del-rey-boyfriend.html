"I didn't know we were being photographed," she said of the pap photos. "I would've worn something different."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When asked if she was nervous about the public's reaction to her decision to date a cop (this is, after all, an era of rising protests against police brutality and mass incarceration), Del Rey defended Larkin. "Well, the thing is, he's a good cop," she said of the man who proudly goes by the nickname "Sticks." "He gets it. He sees both sides of things."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Read on to learn more about Larkin and their breakup.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">He works on two different cop shows.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Sergeant Larkin‚Äìwho <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://twitter.com/Sean_C_Larkin data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=says class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">says</a> he works full time in Tulsa, Oklahoma's police department‚Äìis an analyst on A&E's Live PD and the host of A&E's PD Cam.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">He's really into CrossFit.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In his Instagram bio, he even writes "Part time crossfitter." A cursory scroll through his account reveals about as many shirtless selfies and pull-up videos that you'd imagine a self-labelled "crossfitter" would post.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">He's working on a book.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Sergeant Larkin announced on Twitter last month that he's putting out a book with Dan Abrams, the host at Live PD.</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">He's a dad.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Yes, "Sticks" is also a father.

Posting a screenshot of her voice memos on her phone, one file read, "Grenadine quarantine 2," while another was labeled, "If this is the end ...I want a boyfriend." In other words, she and Sticks are donezo.</p><h2 data-node-id=36 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Sean admits their relationship is over.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In an interview with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/style/sean-larkin-lana-del-rey.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The New York Times" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The New York Times</a>, Larkin revealed that he and the pop star are no longer together.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Right now, we're just friends," he said.

"Normal things couples do with their friends."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=41 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">His children, however, were understandably starstruck.
