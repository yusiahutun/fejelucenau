In the tapes, which were released following Diana's death, the princess described the bodyguard as the "greatest love" she'd ever had. According to Diana, she'd have been "quite happy to give all this up and to just go off and live with him. And he kept saying he thought it was a good idea too."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Although she didn't name Mannakee in the tapes, he's the most likely candidate, as she revealed that her "greatest love" died in a motorcycle accident in 1987, which is how Mannakee tragically passed away.

"It was all found out and he was chucked out. And then he was killed," the princess explained. "And I think he was bumped off. ... We'll never know. He was [the] greatest fella I've ever had." She also said of him, "I was only happy when he was around. ...
