Apparently, there was another member or the Nelson family on stage, too!</p><p>"Lukas Nelson was there, as was Johnny Depp," web producer Jordan wrote on Facebook. "Johnny was incognito and introduced as 'John.' They were all great!"</p><p>Incognito 'John' joined Nelson on stage in his signature fedora, a button-down and a vest. Depp tapped his toes along while he played lead on Nelson's 'On the Road Again,' one of the legend's most famous and recognized songs. The actor appeared comfortable onstage alongside the country icon, who sported his signature braids.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmo6eYo7u6ecOep6llp565rbXEZqWepKOku26uwKyqoqukYsOqsMSoZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
