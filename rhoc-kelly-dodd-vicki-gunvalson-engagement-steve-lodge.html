During Vicki's search, Steve confided in <strong><a href=#>Tamra Judge</a></strong> that he was "already planning my proposal. I already have the ring. Everything's set to go." Vicki suspected something was in the works, but she didn't know when it would happen.</p><p>In another tweet on the same thread, Dodd claimed her former boyfriend, Dr. Brian Reagan, gifted her an engagement ring of her own.

We first got a glimpse of her massive sparkler in April, when "the OG of the O.C." announced to her 1 million Instagram followers that she would be <strong><a href=#>getting hitched for a third time</a></strong>.</p><p>"I said 'YES,'" the 57-year-old life insurance guru captioned a photo of herself cozying up next to Steve while showing off what looked to be a tear-drop diamond, rose-gold ring. No one was happier for her than best friends Tamra and <strong><a href=#>Shannon Beador</a></strong>, who subsequently threw the couple a country-western-themed engagement party. But when Gunvalson documented the affair on social media, fans noticed her ring looked different. This one appeared round, silver and much bigger.</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>But Vicki vehemently denied upgrading her jewelry, telling <strong><a href=#>Bravo's The Lookbook</a></strong>, "Of course it's the same ring!"</p><p>Steve added, "It was a surprise to Vicki. She did not know that I bought it. All she did tell me is that she wanted a round, high-quality diamond in a simple setting."</p><p>According to the couple, Lodge purchased the 18-karat white-gold ring with 5.28 carats of diamonds from Diamonds International, and the cut is called Crown of Light.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:b5e6b4dd-aa9e-5f2d-99a5-b0905e8898e7 data-container-ref=toofab:article:d2e5c5c6-4a93-514b-8042-78bbf0a0abfa data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/29/5by4/2019/04/26/29942450eca1599fa6e661ff034b26a9_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Vicki Gunvalson Is Engaged to Steve Lodge -- See the 'RHOC' Star's Gorgeous Ring!</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Kelly, however, cast doubt over the engagement ring story with her tweet. After all, she and Vicki had a falling out after the latter claimed Dodd had a cocaine addiction, engages in sex trains with multiple men and got banned from her daughter's school -- all of which she's denied. And Dodd, for her part, never seems to miss the opportunity to poke fun at Gunvalson's age, appearance and everything in between.</p><p>Tweeting a boomerang video of the end of Tuesday's episode, which showed credits rolling over footage of Vicki and Shannon having a heated discussion with <strong><a href=#>Emily Simpson</a></strong>, Kelly wrote, "When your grandmas on TV like..."</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>When your Grandmas on TV Like... <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/cCjTbyGDXH</a></p><a href=# rel=noopener>@RHOC_KellyDodd</a><p>"The Real Housewives of Orange County" airs Tuesdays at 9 p.m. on Bravo.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/2d/16by9/2019/08/27/2d4084f798555bc2b1d86eed66c1e93f_md.png width=825 height=464 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><strong>Got a story or a tip for us?
