And nothing proves it more than the way one of the most classic nail trends keeps getting more popular with each passing year: French tip nails. The bright white polish atop nails painted a pinky-nude tone is one of the hottest nail trends today, and it comes in many different pretty modern-day iterations.</p><p>Of course, the original look is already familiar to many of us over the age of 50. But what might not be so well-known to us is how this manicure actually originated.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The origins of French tip nail designs</h2><p>Though it’s called the “French” manicure, this design was actually created in Hollywood in the mid-1970s. Manicurist <a href=# rel=noopener>Jeff Pink, who founded the nail polish company Orly</a>, was doing nails for actresses while shooting movies, and decided that a full color polish change was too time-consuming to accomplish in between takes.</p><p>His solution: the iconic nude and white stripe nail combo that we all know and love. Once the look hit the runways in Paris a few years later, Pink dubbed the style the French manicure. Soon after, he created kits to sell for customers to create the look at home, and that’s when French tip nails went mainstream.&nbsp;</p><p>Fast-forward to today, and once again, iconic French tip nails are popping up&nbsp;everywhere — from the fingers of celebrities like Jennifer Lopez and Jennifer Aniston to being splashed across social media platforms, where new variations seem to pop up by the minute.</p><p>In fact, there’s so many different styles these days that it’s hard to keep up with all the French tip nail trends. Yet one thing we know for sure: Manicurists say the original look and many of its variations are super flattering for ladies over 50.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How French tip nail designs flatter women over 50</h2><p>“The classic choice of pale pink and nude colors in a French manicure are a perfect pick for more mature hands since these shades mimic the natural color of youthful nails,” says&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Rachel Apfel Glass</a>, founder and owner of <a href=# rel=noopener>GLOSSLAB nail salons</a>.</p><p>Plus, the signature white tips counteract the natural yellowing that can affect nails as we age. “The white covers up stains and signs of sun damage and chemical exposure,” says <a href=# rel=noopener>Anna Parvatova</a>, Creative Director at <a href=# rel=noopener>Signature Nail System</a>, a nail product company. “So nails will appear brighter, healthier and more vibrant.”</p><p>Lastly, French tip nails visually lengthen nails and fingers. As Parvatova explains, “The illusion of extended nail length contributes to the appearance of slender, more youthful fingers.”</p><p>“While the traditional pale pink base truly looks great on everyone, don’t be afraid to mix it up,” says Glass. “We have many clients of all ages who are switching out the classic colors for a colored tip or even a colored base, adding designs and more that look stunning on both short and long nails alike!” You’re only limited by your imagination, as many social media influencers can attest to these days.&nbsp;</p><p>Best of all, it’s easy to create French tip nails for yourself at home. There’s really only one caveat: Make sure you are leaving enough dry time between coats. “The base coat should be completely dry to the touch before you apply the tip,” advises Glass. “This ensures a smoother application and helps avoid smudging.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see all the gorgeous designs that are sure to make your nails look très magnifique!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>1. Classic French tip manicure</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/GettyImages-499482638.jpg><p>Sophisticated and timeless, a traditional French manicure is simple to create at home and it works well for both casual and formal occasions. And no need to worry about a steady hand, we found a great way to achieve the look using stickers.</p><p><strong>Get the look:</strong></p><li>Prep nails with a clear base coat, like OPI Natural Nail Base Coat (<a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Buy from Walmart, $9</a>) Let dry.</li><li>Paint on a light pink polish, like OPI Bare My Soul Nail Lacquer (<a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Buy from OPI, $11.49</a>) Let dry.</li><li>Use a set of tweezers to peel off a French manicure nail sticker, like Blulu French Manicure Nail Sticker Strips (<a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Buy from Amazon, $5.25</a>) and apply just below your natural nail line so the tip is exposed. Smooth the sticker down to ensure no nail polish seeps beneath it.</li><li>&nbsp;Starting just above the sticker, use a white polish, like China Glaze Nail Polish in White on White (<a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Buy from Amazon, $7.60</a>) to paint a French tip on each nail. Then immediately remove the sticker with tweezers. Let dry; seal all nails with top coat.</li><h2 class=wp-block-heading>2.
