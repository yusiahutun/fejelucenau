But the catch is Tay’s billionaire status largely comes from her musical endeavors including her tours, album sales, merchandise, and digital streams.</p><p>While Rihanna or Jay-Z’s ‘side hustles’ contributed to their billionaire status, the 12-times-Grammy-winning <a href=#>celebrity</a> proved to be a mastermind when it comes to the music business.</p><p>She gained the billionaire status after her latest re-recording album 1989 Taylor’s Version released worldwide breaking new records.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-music-labels-scared-of-taylor-s-decision>Music labels ‘scared’ of Taylor’s decision</h2><p>Taylor’s quest to ‘own’ her music started years ago. The masters were released with Big Machine Records but later sold off without her consent. And it led to a revolution.</p><p>While many criticized the move, initially skeptical of how successful it will turn out to be, Swifties around the world showed once again that there is nothing ‘impossible’ for Taylor Swift.</p><p>The digital streams of her re-recorded albums along with physical sales led to her becoming a billionaire. But it also prompted record companies to make new rules. This is allegedly so they can stop artists from re-recording the albums within the first two or three decades of release.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/11/GettyImages-1307122848-1024x704.jpg><p>Reports <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">claim</a> big music labels like Universal Music Group, Sony Music Entertainment, and Warner Music Group are now changing their contracts. Bosses reportedly expect new signees to wait 10, 15, or even 30 years before they can re-record an album if need be. They won’t be pulling a Taylor Swift for decades.</p><p>Emphasizing the bizarre new rules, Josh Karp, a music attorney who has seen the new restrictions in UMG contracts <a href=# rel=nofollow>tells</a> Billboard of the new clauses hidden in contracts.</p><p>He said: “I was just like, ‘What is this? This is strange. Why would we agree to further restrictions than we’ve agreed to in the past with the same label?’”</p><p>Gandhar Savur, attorney for Cigarettes After Sex echoes the sentiment. He revealed: “I recently did a deal with a very big indie that had a 30-year re-record restriction in it. Which obviously is much longer than I’m used to seeing.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmppX2WEcMDAsqOoql2oxKqy06xkrKWRp8Fuuc6vnGasmJbBbrnAnZxmoJWneqJ5waKjpaGfo66qvsRmoKxlo5ius7XNoGStoJViura%2FyJxksKeiobFw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
