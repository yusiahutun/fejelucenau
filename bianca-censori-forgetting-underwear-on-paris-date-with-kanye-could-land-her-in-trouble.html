She wore her hair slicked back in a bun, which was <a href=#>different to the bangs she sported last week</a> which fans loved.</p><p>Ye, walking behind, had chosen a black hoodie with it pulled up over his head.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>How come no one has asked why Bianca Censori's tights never unravel????????????</p><p>WHAT MATERIAL BRAND IS IT😭😭😭😭 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/X2SFpWua3s</a></p>— Banks.🇵🇸🇸🇩🇨🇩🇺🇦 (@delineationss) <a href=#>February 28, 2024</a></figure><p>View Tweet</p><p>However, the Daily Mail <a href=# rel=nofollow>reports</a> the spicy outfit could land the celebrity in a heap of trouble, because it’s on the line when it comes to exhibitionism laws in the city.</p><p>If she were to be found in breach of decency laws, Article 22-32 of the new penal code, Bianca Censori could be fined by Paris for forgetting her underwear. This can result in a fine of 100,000 francs, now 15,000 Euros. This would be around $16,224.</p><p>The strictest punishment is listed as one year in jail, which wouldn’t be great for their <a href=#>celebrity</a> image.</p><p><strong>Celebrity Tidbit and GRV Media have approached Kanye West’s representatives for comment.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-it-s-becoming-her-signature-look>It’s becoming her signature look</h2><p>It’s not the first time the <a href=#>celebrity couple</a>‘s outfits have been risky.</p><p>Last year, during their trip to Italy, she was seen walking around in another sheer outfit, which if deemed breaking the law, would have resulted in a fine or prison sentence as well.</p><p>Loals on social media weren’t best pleased with the choices of looks, some branding the decision “disrespectful”.</p><p>They were also investigated by police after Ye was caught with his pants falling down after they enjoyed a boat ride in Venice. Unfortunately, fans were around the music star so managed to get the unlucky moment they fell too far down when he stood up.</p><p>But the boat company were upset, and banned the pair from coming back to their service for life.</p><p>The couple tied the knot in 2022, a few short months after his divorce to reality star Kim Kardashian was finalized.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlqX2eFcK7ImqWcmV2Ysq%2B%2FzqugZp6fp7SmwNOipaBlpaOxpr7WnpirZZ%2BjerGt0aKqZpyRqbJuw8itn2ajkaPGpnnCqKylnF2hrq%2BwjKGcq2WZo3q1vs6umaWdXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
