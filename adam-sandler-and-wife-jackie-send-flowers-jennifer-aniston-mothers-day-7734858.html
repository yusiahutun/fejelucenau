("I have a little arsenal of herbs in my trailer and I make him smoothies when I can and give him all sorts of Chinese herbs when he is exhausted," she once shared on The Tonight Show).

"I was trying to get pregnant.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It was a challenging road for me, the baby-making road…All the years and years and years of speculation... It was really hard,” she added. “I was going through IVF, drinking Chinese teas, you name it. I was throwing everything at it. I would’ve given anything if someone had said to me, ‘Freeze your eggs. Do yourself a favor.’ You just don’t think it. So here I am today. The ship has sailed.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But Aniston assured the outlet that she has "zero regrets."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I actually feel a little relief now because there is no more, ‘Can I?
