He is the son of <a href=#>Steve Harvey </a>and his third wife, Marjorie Harvey. However, Steve is not Jason Harvey’s biological father.

Wynton, Karli, Brandi, and Broderick are Steven Harvey’s children from his previous marriage, thus his stepsiblings. On the other hand, Morgan, Lori, and Jason are Marjorie Harvey's biological children, whom Steve adopted in 2007 after marrying Marjorie.</p><p class=align-left>Not much about Jason Harvey's childhood is known, as he didn't become famous until his stepfather entered the scene. However, he was mostly raised by his mother, with his father imprisoned for most of his life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/13dc591597337584.jpg><p class=align-left>Jason attended a military school for his freshman year of <a href=#>high school</a>.

The company creates designer men's and women's shoes, which are made in Brazil.</p><p class=align-left>The name Yevrah is derived from "Harvey" – spelt backwards. This is perhaps a homage to Jason's stepfather, whom (together with his mother) he credits for teaching him many things about business. His parents also support his venture and often appear on the red carpet <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">wearing his designs</a>.</p><p class=align-left>Besides shoes, Jason is also a clothing designer.
