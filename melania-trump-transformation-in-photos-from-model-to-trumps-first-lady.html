There stood a tall, slender, and attractive long-haired girl with distinct eyes,” he said.</p><p>The model hopeful was initially “shy and reserved” but quickly became comfortable in front of the camera.</p><p>Melanija adopted the alternate spelling of her name, Melania Knauss, as she traveled around Europe for modeling gigs. She found work in the fashion hubs of Paris and Milan, and met Paolo Zampolli, who was a friend of her future husband. She expanded her career to the US following his advice.</p><p>The future first lady met real estate mogul Donald Trump at a party in New York in September 1998.
