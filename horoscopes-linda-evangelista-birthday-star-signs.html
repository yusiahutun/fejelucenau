Her striking good looks meant she was spotted while just a teenager at a local beauty contest and began to consider modelling as a career. Despite nearly turning her back on the fashion industry and getting the Canadian embassy to fly her home after being asked to pose nude in Japan, Linda signed to New York agency Elite after finishing high school. Three years after relocating to Paris in 1984, Linda landed her first assignment and married her first husband, Elite model agency boss Gerald Marie. It was her dramatic change of look which propelled the model into the big time though and Linda famously said that she didn't get out of bed for less than $10,000 a day <span class=st>—&nbsp;</span>a comment which became part of fashion history. Despite her quip, Linda has always said she loves modelling the clothes, the glamorous locations and everything that goes with it. And in an industry renowned for its egos and eccentric behaviour, the statuesque stunner has a reputation for the seriousness with which she approaches her work.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ab87843a4db7-linda-5-a.jpg><p id=emVz1AgNP9f_ data-wc=128>Following her 1993 divorce from Gerald, Linda moved back to the US and began a six-year-relationship withstar Kyle MacLachlan before stepping out with French footballer Fabien Barthez. The couple went on to announce they were expecting a baby, but sadly Linda suffered a miscarriage at six months motherhood remained a priority, though, and in 2006 the runway star, then 41, announced she was expecting again, while keeping mum about the identity of the child's father. When Augustin James Evangelista made his entry into the world on October 11 he fulfilled Linda's most dearly held wish. Despite retiring from modelling in 1997 at the age of 32, Linda was soon back shooting covers with star photographer Mario Testino and still models to this day.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
