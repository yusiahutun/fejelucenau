"As a family we are all trying to hold onto the fact Mum and Dad went together and that neither will ever have to mourn the loss of the other one. Which is a blessing in itself.</p><p id=eHao6L1aLyB data-wc=39>"Although they were both on extremely good form in the days before (hence the sudden idea to go out to lunch), <strong>Mum's Parkinson's and Dad's Dementia had been worsening</strong> and the long-term future was set to be a challenge.</p><p id=ekgUIHTVt3P data-wc=46>"So much so that Mum said to me only a week ago that she had resigned to thinking 'now it looks like we will probably go together'. And so they did. <strong>That was what God had planned for them - and it was a good plan</strong>."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/df7ee70950d7-phil-spencer-d.jpg><p id=eQ2n9OPLpuv data-wc=56>Explaining the circumstances of his parents' deaths, he continued: "The car, going very slowly, toppled over a bridge on the farm drive, upside down into the river. There were no physical injuries and I very much doubt they would have even fought it - they would have held hands under the water and quietly slipped away.</p><p id=esZKz95PolB data-wc=22>"Their carer was in the car and managed to climb out of a back window so the alarm was raised quite quickly.</p><p id=eHQgdzmPO2M data-wc=32>"As many farmers do - my brother had a penknife and so was able to cut the seat belts - he pulled them out of the river but they never regained consciousness.</p><p id=epHDoV7x_9b data-wc=31>"Although desperately sad and shocked beyond all belief - all family are clear that <strong>if there can ever be such a thing as having a 'good end' - this was it.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a7b1071bec55-phil-spencer-kirstie.jpg><p id=e03CPfijn8Z data-wc=31>"It feels horrendous right now, but after almost 60 years of marriage - to die together on the farm they so loved will, I know, be a comfort in the future."</p><p id=eNszI2kUgHE data-wc=20>He ended the statement by adding: "Mum Dad are together which is precisely where they would have wanted to be."</p><p id=eL6sGI2hxQO data-wc=46>The comments section was soon inundated with messages of condolence, including from his Location co-star, Kirstie Allsopp, who wrote: "Such a brave and loving statement and so typical of you & your lovely family.
