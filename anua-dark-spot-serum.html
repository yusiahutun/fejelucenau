As someone with acne-prone skin, I understand the frustration when a deep pimple surfaces or when you can’t resist popping a zit.

Niacinamide has a laundry list of skin-enhancing powers, some of which include <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">minimizing hyperpigmentation</a>, controlling sebum production, boosting hydration, and improving the skin barrier function. Tranexamic acid is known to brighten, even skin tone, lessen redness, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">fade dark spots</a>. Lastly, arbutin boasts melanin synthesis inhibitory properties, meaning it can <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">help lighten skin tone</a>. When a product has this blend of dark spot-fighting ingredients, it’s no wonder why TikTokers and shoppers are hooked.</p><p>To back up these powerful elements, ceramides act as the glue that binds skin cells together. They <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">maintain a healthy skin barrier</a> and lock in moisture, while hyaluronic acid <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">increases hydration</a> by retaining water.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/anua-dark-spot-correcting-serum-amazon.png><p>Besides its cocktail of skin-loving ingredients, the dark spot correcting <a href=# id=auto-tag_serum data-tag=serum>serum</a> takes on a lightweight, non-greasy, watery texture that’s suitable for all skin types. It’s also gentle yet effective, fragrance-free, and cruelty-free.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"></figure><p>Above, you can see real-life results from TikToker <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>@tetka_beauty</a>.
