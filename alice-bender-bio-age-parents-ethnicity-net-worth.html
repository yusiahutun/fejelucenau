Fern is her second-born child who was born in August 2020 as her she lost her first child Aurelia while 29 weeks pregnant in 2019. She had announced her second pregnancy in February of that same year.</p><p>Alice reportedly refused prenatal care because she believed that ultrasounds have radiation. Instead of going to the hospital, she had Fern (second-child) in her bathroom in her apartment in Phoenix, Arizona. She reportedly fished out the placenta from her uterus two hours later. Online records suggested that she believed that all women should be willing to die alone in childbirth rather than go to the hospital or have C-sections.</p><p>Similarly, Alice also found herself in several other controversies when she decided to dress Fern in gender-neutral dresses. Other times, she made him wear her <span class=quote>dead daughter’s dresses.</span></p><p>Many people thought that mothers like Alice shouldn’t be on TikTok because its content has a large audience. The problem was people asked for her advice without her advice derived from her trauma of losing her daughter. Regarding her newborn, she announced the news on Instagram and published a number of images of the natural birth that occurred in her home without any medical assistance.</p><p>“Only a few hours old and you’ve already taught us so much,” the photographs’ captions read. Alice can be seen naked in her bathtub in the pictures (although she has censored all nudity). The remaining slides show her nursing her infant and cuddling her newborn as she is in the bathtub.</p><p>She had previously opened up about not going to welcome her child into this world in hospital. “I am a huge advocate for going all out to make sure you have whatever kind of birth you want to have,” she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">explained</a> on TikTok, “If I had any birth preferences I would definitely make sure they happen, but I don’t. I would be happy giving birth anywhere, baby will come where it comes.”</p><p>“There’s an equal amount of pros and cons to both so I don’t have a preference,” Alice said in response to a follower’s question on whether she would prefer to give birth at home or while traveling.</p><h3><strong>Alice Bender Husband</strong></h3><p>Alice Bender is married to her husband Caleb Bender.

Caleb and his wife, Allison, lost their baby in an accident. Allison is ok, but after an emergency C-section, the baby didn’t make it. Due to these events, work will not be easy (if at all possible) for the couple.”</p><p>The post read further, “We are always talking about how the Hub is a family… #hubnation! Right?

Moreover, she added that Alice only got her daughter’s medical records 2 years later and had to get a lawyer to request them from which she learned that her daughter was given a vitamin K injection.</p><p>As for the man she had an accident with, according to Alice, he had an extensive driving record. He admitted what happened at the scene of the accident. Alice shared that the man had repeat violations going back to when he started driving.
