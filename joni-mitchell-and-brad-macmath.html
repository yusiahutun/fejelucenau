"I lost my virginity and got pregnant in the same moment," says Mitchell, who quit school and headed for Toronto with MacMath. The couple split, however, before their baby, Kelly Dale Anderson, was born on Feb. 19, 1965. There was "nothing more disgraceful" than having a child out of wedlock in those days, Mitchell told the Los Angeles Times in 1997. Alone and unable to support Kelly on her meager earnings as a folk singer, Joni placed her in foster care. A friend, American singer Chuck Mitchell, offered to marry Joni to help her "get my daughter out of hock." But the short-lived marriage didn't take, and reluctantly the destitute mother signed adoption papers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uLTOrJuarJWZxKm7jZympmeUlsGqusZooaimmWK6qsDCoZylpF2Wu6V5wauYnWWdlrCurdOh</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
