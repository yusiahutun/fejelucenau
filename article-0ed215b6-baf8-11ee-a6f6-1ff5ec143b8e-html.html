The man, who hasn’t been identified, was reportedly recovering in a hospital while being treated for smoke inhalation, but that wasn’t confirmed. According to reports from the Jones County Fire Council, the man awakened at approximately 4 a.m. to the sound of his heater “going off” in the home at 3631 Indian Springs Road, and when he got out of bed, he smelled smoke and found flames filling the living room. He helped two other occupants of the single-story brick home escape through windows, too. Volunteers from Calhoun, Pleasant Ridge, Soso and Hebron responded along with EMServ Ambulance medics, who treated the injured and transported them to the hospital. Flames spread into the yard and two vehicles were destroyed in the blaze, according to reports. The people who lived in the house were identified as Donnie and Janice Moore in a GoFundMe account that was set up by Erica Moore to “get some important things they need,” she wrote. “They have lost everything.” <strong>(Photo by Jones County Fire Council)</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKaVrMBwstGenJimlazAcMDWqGShraKpeqq6jJyYpaCfqrtutM6uqp5llp6%2FpnvAq6uim5yarHGxw2tobppmYq%2BispdmaGqdlWKud7KVZmifnmWasHKAkptvnmaYqbqt</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
