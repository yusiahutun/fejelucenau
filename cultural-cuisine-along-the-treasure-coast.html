In Port St. Lucie, two dining establishments <span class=s2>have turned the area into a hub for those seeking a taste of </span><span class=s3>Portugal. At </span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class=s4>Fernando’s Dockside Grille</span></a><span class=s3>, Chef Fernando</span> <span class=s2>Dovale—a veteran of the Hyatt hotel chain and Manhattan’s</span> Rainbow Room—has brought his Mediterranean cooking to the tropics. Signature dishes include pork Alentejana (marinated and fried tenderloin with littleneck clams) and <span class=s2>bacalhau (salt cod), the European nation’s most traditional</span> dish, prepared several different ways.</p><p class=p2><span class=s1>Over at </span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class=s5>Luso Portuguese Grille</span></a><span class=s1>, the menu reflects Portugal’s coastal heritage with a focus on seafood like octopus, cod, and shrimp cooked Mozambique-style. Meat dishes include the traditional bifé (black angus New York strip with a special molho, or, sauce) and picanha (thinly sliced and grilled top sirloin).<i>&nbsp;</i></span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2020/07/octipus-1024x683.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1><b>Jamaican</b></span></p><p class=p2>The dean of Jamaican cooking in the area is, by all accounts, Kevin McLean. Owner of<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class=s6> Classic Jamaican Jerk Stop</span></a>, with locations in Stuart and Palm City, McLean’s best-selling oxtail, curried goat, and jerk chicken and pork are available to-go or on-site in the small dining area. “Many of our customers have traveled to Jamaica,” he says. “We use only imported spices for authenticity. When Jamaicans taste our food, they feel like they’ve come home.”<i>&nbsp;</i></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2020/07/Jamaican-Jerk-Stop-007-1024x683.jpg><p class=p2><span class=s1>In Port St. Lucie, </span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class=s5>One Love Jamaican & Seafood </span></a><span class=s1>definitely satisfies a craving for seafood: At this quaint spot, crawfish, snapper, blue and snow crabs, and shrimp are prepared many different ways—curried, in a garlic sauce, or combined with lobster, corn, and sausage. Lunch specials include traditional items such as brown stew chicken and roasted pork.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p2>Also in Port St. Lucie,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class=s6> Jerk City</span></a> serves classic island specialties out of its Mangrove Square location, as does <span class=s6>The Spot (561-856-3823<i>)</i></span> in Fort Pierce.<i>&nbsp;</i></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2020/07/DSC_2288-1024x684.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1><b>Indian</b></span></p><p class=p2><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class=s6>Taj Indian Restaurant and Bar</span></a> in Port St. Lucie features one of the most comprehensive Indian menus in the area, along with a full bar and a lunch buffet featuring a live dosa (similar to a crêpe and made with rice batter) station. In addition, the kitchen grinds all of its spices in-house and uses them to formulate proprietary blends noted for freshness and flavor. “The way we use spices makes our food much closer to what you would experience in India,” says co-owner Suman Subedi. “It’s similar to the difference between canned and fresh spinach.”</p><p class=p2><span class=s1>In Stuart, two more restaurants offer a wonderful overview of the Indian subcontinent’s cuisine. The menu at </span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class=s5>Namaste Grill</span></a><span class=s1> is inspired by the culture of India as well as Nepal, with biryani rice dishes and a variety of items cooked in </span><span class=s2>a traditional tandoor oven. </span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class=s7><b>India Palace </b></span></a><span class=s2>specializes in modern interpretations of classics, including delicious entrée</span><span class=s1>s from South India and Indochina.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1><b>German</b></span></p><p class=p2><span class=s2>In addition to her American fusion menu, Chef Lenh prepares a range of German</span> specialties at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class=s6>Ethan’s Grill</span></a> in Hobe Sound. Think: sauerbraten, roulade, goulash, red cabbage, strudel, and schnitzel pounded to order. German wines and beers are available, along with typical cocktails such as the Hugo—a variation of a mojito with prosecco, elderflower syrup, and muddled mint.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2020/07/HoffmannC-06660-1024x683.jpg><p class=p2>At <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class=s6>The Hoffmann</span></a> in Jensen Beach, Thomas Hoffmann has created a waterfront setting with the atmosphere of a Bavarian biergarten. Like Ethan’s Grill, the menu is divided between American fusion and traditional German dishes, with German beers such as Bitburger and Hofbräu on tap. Enjoy them with a view of the Indian River.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1><b>Vietnamese</b></span></p><p class=p2>The Huynh family emigrated from Vietnam to Port St. Lucie in 1993 and opened <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class=s6>Pho Deli</span></a>, where they specialize in the national dish of Vietnam—pho—a main-course soup that varies according to region of origin. Their signature “Pho Deli” dish features rare beef eye round, well-done flank steak, brisket, and meatballs in a broth that takes two days to make. Chicken, seafood, and vegetarian versions are also available. “Our soup is rich in flavor,” says owner Tam Huynh. “It’s comfort food and perfect when it’s chilly outside or when you’re not feeling well.” Pho Deli has as second location in Fort Pierce as well.</p><p class=p2><span class=s1>You can also get your pho on at </span><span class=s5>Pho Now</span><span class=s1> (772-777-4116) in Port St. Lucie and </span><span class=s5>Pho 772 (<span class=s1>772-261-8240)</span></span> in Jensen Beach, which serve the staple as well as a variety of other Vietnamese dishes<span class=s1> such as bánh mì, stir-fry, and rice platters.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2020/07/img_2937-1024x768.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1><b>Cuban</b></span></p><p class=p2><span class=s1>Get a great Cuban sandwich and mail your packages at the same time at<br></span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class=s6>Mervis’ Café & Grill</span></a>. The Fort Pierce establishment, founded in 2001, double<span class=s1>s as a USPS contract unit. “We had customers who were local mail carriers, and they mentioned they were looking to open a contract unit in the area,” says owner Ivel Sierra. “We had enough parking, so we won the bid.” Sierra makes the most popular Cuban sandwich around, the same way his father taught him to in the 1970s: ham, swiss cheese, fresh-roasted pork, mustard, pickles—and a whole lot of love. <span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tMDUmqmtpZGcrru1zZ5lnKedZLOwu8NmmKecXZm%2FqrrKaKmeq6SWwrOtza1kp52nqHykwcutrKuZnGKwtrXSoqWeZZGhvK%2BzjK2fnmWkp7Kiv9SrnGabn5bAtXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
