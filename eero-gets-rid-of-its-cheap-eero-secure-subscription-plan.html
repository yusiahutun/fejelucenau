  Eero announced that it would be taking away the Eero Secure plan not too long ago, and today, users began getting notifications that they would be moved to the more expensive Eero Plus plan (formerly Eero Secure Plus)."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The previous plan was $3 a month, or $30 a year. And it was pretty good given that it gave you access to the basics, such as ad-blocking and activity insights.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How to Set Up the Eero Home Wi-Fi System</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The advantages the more expensive plan gave you were pretty much just Dynamic DNS and subscriptions to 1Password, Encrypt.me, and Malwarebytes. If you didn't care about any of those four things, you could get away with paying much less. Now, though, you'll be forced to move to it, even if you're currently paying the standard plan.</p><p>Suddenly making people on a $3 plan start paying $10 might be a little extreme, but it will be your only option if you want to keep those premium Eero features.</p><p>Source: <a href=#>The Verge</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGhvbWhlbIFwscSrpmaflanAbr7InWSonl2ewbR5wqGcmqhdmrKzu4ysnJytopp6tMHBrJqroaCptrC6jKmjmqZf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
