The Ironman actress was dating Matt’s best friend <a href=#>Ben Affleck</a> at the time. Their romance became known to the public after the Jason Bourne star announced his single status in an interview with <a href=#>Oprah Winfrey</a> in 1998 implicating he and Good Will Hunting co-star Minnie Driver had broken up.</p><p>He then began making public appearances with none other than <a href=#>Johnny Depp’s famous ex</a> Winona Ryder.

The couple has been married for 18 years now and shares four daughters.</p><p>Winona on the other hand has been in a steady relationship with fashion designer Scott Mackinlay Hahn since 2011.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-matt-s-ex-girlfriend-and-co-star-minnie-driver-makes-headlines>Matt’s ex-girlfriend and co-star Minnie Driver makes headlines</h2><p>It was Matt’s ex, Minnie Driver’s, recent comment on <a href=#>Instagram</a> which sparked discussions about his romance with Winona. It was after a fan page posted a clip from the 1998 Oscars which showed Matt and Ben winning an award for Good Will Hunting.</p><p>The clip shows Ben giving a winning speech on the Oscar stage as a gleaming Matt stands next to him. A side-by-side view clip showed Minnie looking very sad despite a big win for her movie.</p><p>When a fan asked why she looked so sad.
