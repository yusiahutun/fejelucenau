To narrow down the pool, InStyle testers incorporated each cleansing balm into their routine for two weeks and ranked every product from 1 to 5 in five key categories: consistency, oiliness, hydration, cleansing ability, and appearance. In doing so, we were able to suss out the not-so-stellar formulas to deliver readers the 13 best cleansing balms. At the top of the list is the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Juno & Co.

I usually prefer to double cleanse; however, this is effective enough to be used alone.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Beyond its ease of use, our tester also says that this cleansing balm is incredibly hydrating. “This cleanser has been fantastic for me because it thoroughly cleans without drying out my skin — my complexion actually feels more moisturized and supple after using it,” she shares.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The only potential downside of the balm is that, because the packaging isn’t the highest quality, you have to be careful not to drop or over-twist it while putting the lid back on because it can crack pretty easily.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Pearl barley and vitamin E |<strong> Size: </strong>3 oz.<strong> </strong>| <strong>Scented: </strong>No</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=2555 data-sizes=750px alt="An open jar of Juno & Co.

Made with difficult-to-source ingredients — including Egyptian chamomile oil and eucalyptus oil — it instantly hydrates and softens the skin while effortlessly removing makeup. That said, our tester points out that it has a chunkier consistency than any cleansing balm she’s tried, which she admits is uncomfortable while removing eye makeup.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">That doesn’t deter her from recommending it though. “This balm leaves my skin feeling hydrated after cleansing — no tightness or dryness at all; my skin feels soft rather than stripped,” she shares.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Something that sets this cleansing balm apart — besides its much heftier price tag — is the fact that it comes with muslin cloth for light exfoliation during cleansing. While some people seem to love it (including our tester), others choose to avoid it. As such, it’s not entirely necessary to enjoy the product.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Egyptian chamomile oil, clove oil, eucalyptus oil, and hops oil |<strong> Size: </strong>3.3 oz.<strong> </strong>| <strong>Scented: </strong>Yes</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-5 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=2688 data-sizes=750px alt="Eve Lom Cleansing Balm" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/FoPnXK-52_lF_17Q7t3ShEdNfEU=/fit-in/1500x2688/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-cleansing-balms-test-eve-lom-karen-chen-02-f7599788a59944d3a8bb3caa974551d6.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Karen Chen</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=2513 data-sizes=750px alt="Eve Lom Cleansing Balm" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/9-BMmkRtsLbbmNJ1RgUaoF1gOVE=/fit-in/1500x2513/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-cleansing-balms-test-eve-lom-karen-chen-01-406367256fd249eaaa333c8972aaecde.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Karen Chen</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-drugstore-neutrogena-makeup-remover-melting-balm></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Drugstore</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Neutrogena Makeup Remover Balm</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Neutrogena Makeup Remover Melting Balm" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/QFtBemdggABhfI_jsSnLwk-6AOM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/NeutrogenaMakeupRemoverMeltingBalm-656ec08c00d142fabad94de76fdf9d43.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Thousands of Amazon shoppers agree: Neutrogena Makeup Remover Melting Balm is a must. Unlike most cleansing balms, this product has a lotion-like consistency (it’s not a hard surface that must be scraped to turn into balm). The silky-smooth texture allows it to sink effortlessly into the skin, which is a blessing for our tester who struggles to find hydrating products that work well with her oily skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“This product helped me with my oily skin, which is interesting to me because [I wouldn’t expect to] fight oily skin with a slightly oily feeling product,” she says. “After cleansing, my skin felt so smooth and soft. Usually, it feels tight after washing it with my normal cleanser, but with this, there was no tightness — just soft, supple skin,” she marvels.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The one downside for our tester is that it caused her to break out. “I have really sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts with new products,” she admits, pointing out that it’s not necessarily an issue with the product itself. That said, it’s formulated with coconut oil, which tends to be a pore-clogging culprit.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Carnauba wax, coconut oil, and vitamin E |<strong> Size: </strong>2 oz.<strong> </strong>| <strong>Scented: </strong>No</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-7 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=2472 data-sizes=750px alt="Neutrogena Makeup Remover Melting Balm on fingertips" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/E5Ax33McBxT23pYktDLknI_4xbY=/fit-in/1500x2472/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-cleansing-balms-test-neutrogena-makeup-remover-melting-jennifer-may-01-8242ecf6a472429bad951e82dbe79ec1.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Jennifer May</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=2463 data-sizes=750px alt="Neutrogena Makeup Remover Melting Balm" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/T6_vs2W_d9PhMAFsAckwc-WZ-7g=/fit-in/1500x2463/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-cleansing-balms-test-neutrogena-makeup-remover-melting-jennifer-may-03-e83ead0f10b14e2fb62ab81c0ef2d9b6.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Jennifer May</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-multitasking-elemis-pro-collagen-cleansing-balm></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Multitasking</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Elemis Pro-Collagen Cleansing Balm</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Elemis Pro-Collagen Cleansing Balm" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/b6z4g2gb0xQJyVjfDuzk2JEHhIY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/elemis-pro-collagen-cleansing-balm-5a9e3b41caf742b3973349dff49bb6da.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Elemis Pro-Collagen Cleansing Balm has earned hundreds of five-star reviews for its transformative formula that starts out as a balm before emulsifying into an oil and eventually a cleansing milk. The popular cleansing balm is formulated with rose and mimosa waxes, as well as elderberry, starflower, and optimega oils.

Though she wasn’t able to double cleanse during the test, she thinks this product would be the perfect first step to any cleansing routine because it left her skin feeling extremely soft. “This would work great as part of a team of products, but individually, I think you could find better out there.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-89 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Effectiveness aside, this cleansing balm comes in a tube, which makes it convenient for daily use as well as during travel.

It’s formulated with exfoliating sunflower and ginger root oils, as well as papaya enzymes to slough away built-up debris, making it especially great for oily, acne-prone skin types. That said, our tester was less than impressed: She found that the balm was more chalky than oily (despite being a slick balm in the pot) and felt clumpy during use. Additionally, she found that it wasn’t the most effective at removing a full face of makeup, as she had to follow up with micellar water during both of her tests.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though our tester didn’t have the best experience, we felt it was important to mention it because many of our editors swear by this balm and think it’s still a stellar option.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text><a href=#>Banila Co.

As effective as these oils are at ridding the skin of excess sebum, Dr. Hammerman says that there are a few things you’ll want to keep in mind when shopping for a high-quality cleansing balm.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Ingredients such as coconut oil, almond oil, vitamin E, coconut milk, and shea butter deliver high doses of hydration,” she says. “Sea buckthorn, olive oil, and grapeseed oil provide antioxidants and nourishing fatty acids.” Furthermore, she says that persimmon extract helps to reduce hyperpigmentation, while eucalyptus oil, sunflower oil, ginger root oil, and papaya promote exfoliation and help unclog pores. Additionally, she says that chamomile oil is softening and smoothing, while hops oil, moringa seed oil, and wild sea fennel work well for toning.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Tacking onto this, Joie Tavernise, an NYC-based skin expert and medical esthetician who is the founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">JTAV Clinical Skincare</a>, says that cleansing balms formulated with hyaluronic acid, peptides, and ceramides are especially beneficial, as they not only remove oil, dirt, and makeup, but they nourish skin to restore a plump, dewy complexion, too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">That said, there are a few ingredients to steer clear of, too — primarily depending on your skin type. “If you have oily or acne-prone skin, look for non-comedogenic products,” Tavernise says, noting to avoid coconut oil, lanolin, algae extract, and isopropyl myristate — which she says are great for dry skin but can clog pores and worsen breakouts on oily complexions. “If you have sensitive skin, avoid any balms with ingredients that can dry out and irritate the skin like alcohol and salt.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Scent</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Even the most natural scents can cause irritation if they’re not truly natural, or if they’re the byproduct of ultra-strong essential oils. With that in mind, consider your complexion and how it reacts before opting for a product that has a notable scent. Generally speaking, no scent is the best scent.

For best results, Dr. Hammerman says to use a quarter-sized amount. When dislodging it from the jar, use the included spatula (if your balm comes with one) or the back of your nail to keep the product as sanitary as possible. Then, rub the cleansing balm between your fingers and massage it into your skin for about 30 seconds.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“The balm will transform into an oil that helps remove dirt, oil, and makeup,” Dr. Hammerman says. At that point, you can add lukewarm water to emulsify the oil and fully rinse the product (and all the debris with it) away. Once you’ve finished washing your face, pat dry with a towel (ideally one that’s microfiber, as they’re the most gentle).</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Can you use cleansing balm on your eyes?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Yes! That’s one of the biggest perks of cleansing balm. “A cleansing balm will not irritate your eyes like a traditional soap,” Dr. Hammerman explains. In fact, since cleansing balms are made with oils designed to lift away other oils, dirt, and debris, they actually tend to be the most effective on the most stubborn makeup. “With the formulation, it can be more effective at removing waterproof sunscreen, and waterproof and heavy-duty makeup than a traditional cleanser,” board-certified dermatologist ​​Jenny Liu, MD, adds. Just be sure to fully rinse away the balm post-use to avoid any potential irritation from lingering oils, Tavernise says.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Can you use a cleansing balm when you're not wearing makeup?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Absolutely! Just because cleansing balm works especially well to remove makeup doesn’t mean it can’t be used as an effective cleanser on bare skin. According to ​​Dr. Liu, cleansing balms offer a gentle solution for removing sunscreen, oil, dirt, and any other lingering debris, too —&nbsp;all without over-drying the skin, like so many classic gel and cream cleansers do.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You don’t have to use them for just cleansing, either. “I love applying a balm to dry skin and leaving it on for 20 minutes as a mask to give my dry skin a little TLC,” Tavernise says.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Are cleansing balms better for those with dry or oily skin?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Cleansing balms are great for all skin types. “They are excellent for anyone with redness and/or sensitive skin because they calm and soothe,” Tavernise says. “Cleansing balms are also good for those with oily skin who sometimes tend to dry out their skin with harsh products to attempt to clear the acne.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">On that note, Tavernise assures us that it’s a common misconception that ultra-hydrating, oil-based cleansing balms will wreak havoc on oily skin. “Oily skin actually needs oil in order to be healthy; if you strip it too much your body produces more oil to counteract this and can lead to even more breakouts,” she explains. In that way, she says that cleansing balms are a great choice, especially in the colder months, because they help balance oil production while simultaneously clearing away built-up oil, dirt, and makeup.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">That’s not to say that cleansing balms aren’t beneficial for dry skin, too, though. “Since cleansing balms are rich in nourishing oils, they are especially great for dry skin, and you do not have to worry about them drying out or stripping the skin,” Dr. Hammerman says.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">InStyle beauty writer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Rebecca Norris</a> has been honing her beauty knowledge for nearly 10 years.
