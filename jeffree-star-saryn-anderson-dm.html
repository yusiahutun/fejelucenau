He has been giving a sneak peek of his beau on social media as well, making people guess who he is.&nbsp;</p><p>The beauty guru tweeted the first photo on January 28, 2023, with the message, “Goodbye LA, time to spend time with my #NFL boo in Wyoming 🏈.”</p><p>And web investigators were tripping over themselves to discover who the mysterious American football player was. Everything in the photograph has been studied, from the breadth of his legs to the curvature of his ankles and even the way he ties his shoelaces.</p><p>Many others saw what seemed to be a mole, freckle, or mark from an intravenous line on his hand, which they thought may suggest he had recently undergone surgery.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Jeffree-Star-NFL.jpeg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Jeffree Star has been teasing his NFL boyfriend on Twitter. (Source: <a href=# rel=noopener>Twitter</a>)</p><p>The internet sleuths even went so far as to identify the plane, its cabin area, and how tall the player would be. Many people claimed to have solved the riddle but refused to provide a straight answer to keep the mystery alive.</p><p>On January 29, 2023, Star gave another look at his NFL boyfriend in an Instagram photo that featured his mystery man wearing a Louis Vuitton co-ord with his back to the camera.</p><p>Star took the picture in the bathroom mirror while holding what seemed to be a pistol near the sink. “His team didn’t make it to the #SuperBowl but he’s 6’6 and plays perfect in the bedroom,” the caption read.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jeffree Star leaked Saryn Anderson’s text</h2><p>As said before, nobody knows who Star’s mystery boyfriend is. However, many are speculating it to be Henry.&nbsp;</p><p>Henry is the defensive end for the Carolina Panthers of the NFL and is 6’6” tall. Similarly, his team did not make it to SuperBowl this year, leading to rumors of him being Star’s mystery beau.</p><p>Following the rumors, Henry’s wife since 2019, Saryn, texted Star on Instagram. She replied to his story, saying the public was harassing her because they believed her husband to be Star’s beau.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>She also asked him to stop teasing his fans and followers. The beauty mogul uploaded the screenshot of the DM to his Twitter and wrote how the “NFL wives” were coming after him.</p><p>He asked them not to be insecure since he did not “mess with married men.” To date, Star has not revealed who his NFL boyfriend is.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jeffree Star’s dating history</h2><p>Before Star’s current <a href=# rel=noopener>relationship</a>, he had a couple of partners. His first known relationship was reportedly with Cara Cunningham.</p><p>The two allegedly dated from May 2005 to July 2009, but it has not been confirmed.&nbsp;</p><p>Star was linked to Tyler Carter, lead vocalist of the American boy band Issues, in 2015, according to the celebrity rumor website, Who’s Dated Who. Little is known about their purported romance, with rumors claiming it was only a fling.&nbsp;</p><p>Skateboarder Nathan Schwandt is Star’s longest and most public relationship. They dated for five years, from March 2015 to January 2020, after Schwandt snuck into the beauty guru’s Instagram DMs.&nbsp;</p><p>Star frequently uploaded videos of the couple’s lives, which they lived with a family of Pomeranians. Unfortunately, their relationship did not last long.</p><p>Star released a 17-minute YouTube video titled ‘We Broke Up’ in January 2020 to announce the couple’s split sadly. The beauty guru listed various reasons for the breakup, including Schwandt’s distaste for the spotlight, losing one of their dogs, and family health issues.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Jeffree and Nate had been rock solid for 5 years inspite of all the rumours and shit. They have been through a lot and came so long. Their breakup is heartbreaking. I NO LONGER BELIEVE IN TRUE LOVE Y’ALL 😭💔 <a href=# rel=noopener>#jeffreestar</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/SyiANaFmUU</a></p>— sj (@isjsandhu) <a href=# rel=noopener>January 11, 2020</a></figure><p>After a couple of months of break up, Star posted a series of photos with TV personality Jozea Flores, who has appeared on Big Brother and The Challenge.</p><p>He explained to followers that neither of them is seeking a serious relationship now but that they are merely “exploring” where the date may go. Neither announced an official relationship, and Star soon began seeing someone else.</p><p>Basketball player Andre Marhold became Star’s boyfriend in the summer of 2020. The beauty mogul initially concealed Marhold’s identity by uploading a photo of himself sitting on the lap of a man whose face fans couldn’t see.</p><p>However, online detectives took little time to deduce Marhold’s identity based on his unusual arm tattoos. Once their secret was out, Star began posting images of the couple together.</p><p>However, their short-lived relationship was filled with drama, with Star accusing his beau of stealing from him. Since then, Star has been teasing that he is dating someone but has not revealed his identity.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6yfnl6YvK57xLGapa2jnsOme8menZ%2BqlZp6tMDAq2SsmaKuu26tzZ2cq6ufo3qluY4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
