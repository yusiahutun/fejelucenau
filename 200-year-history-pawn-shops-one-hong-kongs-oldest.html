There are pawn shops in most of the city’s 18 districts.

In other words, you take something that you own to the pawnshop, and if the owner is interested, they will lend you the some money while they hold onto the item. The shop will then keep it until you are able to repay the loan.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>Hong Kong is one of the most expensive cities in the world, so many people need quick access to money. Pawn shops are therefore still popular. In 1821, there were 16 pawnbrokers in the city; now there are more than 200.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>These shops are viewed as a business, and regulated by the government. They are not allowed to charge more than 3.5 per cent interest per month, and loans are restricted to HK$100,000 or less.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>In the past, customers would pawn blankets, shoes, and other household items – things that are common now, but were highly valued at the time. Now, people mostly pawn gold, jewellery and watches. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><a href=# class="BodyLink__StyledLink-sc-1uefa8x-0 cJwLWs"><strong type=strong><span type=text>The lasting impact of Hong Kong's Jewish community</span></strong></a></p><p><h3 type=h3><span type=text>Outside intervention</span></h3></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>The activities of the pawnbrokers were limited during the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong in the second world war because Japan required Hong Kong to use Japanese yen as currency. Pawn shops did not do that.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>To revive the city’s economy after the war, the British colonial rulers helped the pawnbroking industry to flourish. In 1947, the Hong Kong & Kowloon Pawnbrokers Association Limited was set up.</span></p><p><h3 type=h3><span type=text>The symbolism</span></h3></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>Hong Kong’s pawn shops have distinct features. The first thing you see when you enter a shop is a large, rectangular, wooden screen. This is meant to hide clients from passers-by. The shop’s counter, which is directly behind the wooden screen, is rather tall. This is to emphasise the superior status of the pawnbroker and to prevent people from seeing how the employees appraise the goods.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>Pawn shops names are unique as well. They tend to include words which are associated with the idea of being harmonious or prosperous. The hope is that this will encourage business, and bring good luck.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>Some examples include Tung Cheong, which means “together in harmony”, and Wing Bo, which means “an everlasting treasure”.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>The sign design, with the upside-down bat and coin, is also lucky. The Chinese word for bat, “fook”, sounds similar to that for “fortune”, while the phrase “upside-down bat” sounds similar to “fook dau”, which means “good fortune has arrived”.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>But they’re not always lucky. In 2015, a famous pawnshop in Wan Chai was demolished to make way for a commercial tower. This was met with fierce opposition from the public due to the shop’s cultural significance and heritage.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>So the next time you the neon sign of a pawnshop, make sure to take some photographs while you still have the chance.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kxrF7w6KqnKemmr9wuMifnKysqaGycLLEmquuqpWofKK%2B06KapZ1faH16gZJramhqYGV6urHAq2ShoaOpvLPFjKmYsKZdqLWwvNJmpqedXZ28r7OMpKann6NivK2wxKyr</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
