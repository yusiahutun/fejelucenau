So why aren’t they allowed and could agents help break the stranglehold the top two or three jockeys have over the championship?
Jockey agents have never been permitted by the Jockey Club, officials arguing that riders at Sha Tin are not presented with the same logistical challenges as they are in other jurisdictions."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

We’re not sure, and given Moreira would have an agent as well, maybe that argument is simply clutching at straws.</p><p>Yet, if even Moreira thinks it would be beneficial, then why not?</p><p><img title="Trainer Dennis Yip and Joao Moreira share a moment after a win." width=660 height=385 data-resolution=2 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/11/10/58bf7eda-c5fd-11e7-9f00-d8b0ccf89a9f_1320x770_180648.JPG style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>The other underlying reason, beyond logistics, is integrity.</p><p>Without getting into the details of how jockey agents would be licensed, the move would create another group of people the club would want to monitor.</p><p>As it stands, the club provide jockeys with phones that they are asked to use with relation to bookings and conversations with trainers.</p><p>Those phones can be asked for as evidence in inquiries, as can bank account details under rules brought in last year.</p><p>Throw agents into the mix and officials fear it would open a can of worms.</p><p>In a tipping culture, the agents would be seen to have “privileged information”. Jockeys have a strong counterpoint here and a case study of a place where agents “work”, Japan.</p><p>The power of the insider tip is just as strong in Japan and the jurisdiction boats similarly astronomic turnover.</p><p>Agents there are strictly monitored and even though Japan has more tracks, the JRA circuit is limited to three meetings per week, albeit with each of them stretched over two days.</p><p>Now, we haven’t heard many riders putting their hands up to be kept in “jockey jail” before and between back-to-back meetings as they are in Japan.</p><p>“Jockey jail” is the nickname for the housing where jockeys stay “locked up” and denied communications with the outside world on race eve in Japan.</p><p>Some would argue the worst thing you could do is lock jockeys in a house together the night before a race meeting and that it would be a more effective strategy to ban them from speaking to each other at all.</p><p><a href=#>Hong Kong Jockey Club bets on latest ‘crazy’ vision to be a winner in Conghua</a></p><p>Perhaps the bold new frontier of Conghua Training Centre offers a new opportunity for a conversation about agents to be revisited – the mainland base does present some new logistical issues.</p><p>Still, jockeys should expect an uphill battle when it comes to convincing a club that wants to maintain an iron-fisted control over its licensees.</p><p>Comments</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1mq5mTnruoe8Crq6KbnJp8c32Qcmpub1%2BdvK%2BzjKSmp5%2BjYr%2BqsMSrqmavkaPBbq3GnqWtq12svLa4w2ahqJubmsZur8uumWaqlaG2r73UoqqhZZOku7W%2BzqU%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
