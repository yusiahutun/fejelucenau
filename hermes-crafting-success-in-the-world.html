Every brand has an inspirational story. Have you ever thought about the story behind these brands? The stories of their origin, the cities they came from?&nbsp;</p><p>When we talk about luxury, heritage, craftsmanship, and stylishness in ultra-luxury leather and silk products, there’s one name that easily comes to our mind – <a href=# rel=noopener>Hermes</a>. In this article, we will get to know the story of this unique luxury brand.</p><p>Let’s go through the deep story of the brand, from selling Haut à Courroies (saddle bags) to Hermès Birkin. In short, let’s discuss the origin, history, <a href=# rel=noopener>marketing strategies</a>, and market presence of the brand.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>History of Hermes:&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theenterpriseworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Web-Images-2.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Challenges Faced By <strong>Hermes:</strong></h3><li><strong>Continuous takeover interest from LVMH:</strong> The brand has faced persistent takeover interest from rival LVMH, which quietly acquired a 17% stake between 2002 and 2010. This led to a legal dispute, resulting in LVMH selling down its stake. The brand defends its independence through a private holding company with the first right of rejection for family share sales, preventing LVMH takeover. In 2011, over 50 Hermès successors formed a co-operative named H51, holding 50.2% of shares and assuring not to sell it for two decades. Two family members outside the cooperative also resisted LVMH, ensuring that the brand operates independently.</li><li><strong>Succeeding in China:</strong> The brand is taking a careful and creative approach to enter into China’s luxury market. Despite being in China since 1997, they have opened only one store each year since 2015. They plan to make each store a special experience, highlighting craftsmanship and connecting with China’s traditions. This is different from the developing shopping culture in Asia. In 2012, they also launched Shang Xia, a Chinese luxury brand that focuses on Chinese craftsmanship. The company keeps its brand exclusive by avoiding flashy displays, logos, and celebrity advertisements that are suitable with the government’s restriction on excessive displays of wealth. However, whether this strategy works depends on how Chinese consumers view luxury Products.</li><li><strong>Strengthening the Hermes brand equity beyond leather and silk:</strong> The brand is known for its luxury leather and silk products and is working on strengthening its brand in other categories. For example, its watchmaking division, La Montre Hermès, has a 90-year history but only contributed 3% to the brand’s total revenue in 2019. The newly appointed CEO sees potential for qualitative growth but admits it will be a slow journey to establish the watchmaking division. Similarly, other categories like perfumes and jewelry are growing in sales, but they haven’t reached the success levels of the leather and saddlery products division. They aim to build stronger brand equity beyond its traditional strengths in leather and silk.</li><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Top 5 Competitors of Hermes:</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theenterpriseworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Web-Images-3-Source-garlandmag.jpg><li><strong>Chanel:</strong> It is a private company owned by the Wertheimer family and the headquarters of the company is located in London.
