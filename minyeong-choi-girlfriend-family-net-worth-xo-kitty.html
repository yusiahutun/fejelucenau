His character first met Kitty in</span><i><span style=font-weight:400> To All the Boys: Always and Forever</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> when Kitty visits Seoul to attend the </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Korean Independent School of Seoul (KISS)</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> — the same school Dae attended. Since then, the two y began a long-distance relationship and they spoke every day.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>“What I love about Dae is that he is warmhearted,” Minyeong spoke about his character. “When he wants to win someone’s heart, he only uses sincerity. He knows how important love is.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But Minyeong also wants his character “to learn how to transform his relationship [with Kitty] from lovers to friends.” Though it may be hard, “but if you can do that, you can still keep…the person. That’s not only about just partners; it’s just love again. So I really hope that Dae keeps the love towards Kitty,” he added.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Overall, Minyeong was just happy to have landed the role when Dae was recast.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>After becoming the new Dae, he then had to reshoot scenes on his own — which may look like CGI to some viewers, but it is not. “Everything is me, like the body. They had the same clothes,” Minyeong explained. “That happens often on set, so that was okay. But I remember that it was really sunny on set that day, so you can see that my eyes [squint], and I was [trying so hard not to] blink.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Like many of his co-stars, Minyeong also joined the series through an open call. In fact, he was the last one to be added to the final cast. “From the day I sent my self-tape to the day I heard that I was cast, [I think] it only took a month. It was really quick,” he recalled.</span></p><h3><b>Minyeong Choi Net Worth</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Minyeong Choi garnered a net worth of under $500 thousand by 2023.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>This actor started his journey as a musical actor in 2012 when he was just ten in the musical </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>구름빵 ( Cloud Bread)</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.&nbsp; “Actually, I was a cat.
