Teenage Chris in a suit? Check (multiple times over). Sports team portraits from&nbsp;his days playing baseball, basketball and more? Check, check and check.</p><p>What's perhaps most incredible about Morgane's treasure trove of photos is that we (gasp!) can actually see Stapleton's chin and cheeks! His long, slightly unruly beard is nowhere to be found -- heck, he's never sporting much more than a light mustache in these old photos.</p><p>All told,&nbsp;Morgane shared dozens of photos via both Instagram and Instagram Stories (see them all below). "I hope y'all will enjoy this as much as I do," she wrote as she shared the first batch, and, honestly, we probably enjoyed it&nbsp;even more than she did.</p><p>"This guy ... My sweetheart ... You make everything better. I love you more than I know how to say," Morgane writes. "Thank you for sharing your world with me. I wouldn't trade a single day."</p><p>Married since 2007, the Stapletons have five children: Wayland and Ada are their oldest son and daughter, respectively, but they are also the parents of twin boys, Macon and Samuel, who were born in 2018, and a fifth child, a son, born in 2019.</p><p>The couple keep their children out of the spotlight for the most part, but Morgane did divulge a couple of small details about them in her birthday posts for her husband: first, that Wayland&nbsp;inherited one particularly retro suit from his father, and second, that four of their five children look more like him than like her.</p><p><b>Here's What Chris Stapleton Looked Like Before Country Stardom (and Before His Beard):</b></p><p><strong>The Top 10 Chris Stapleton Songs:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmnKCinsBuv9Oap6WdpKS7brvLnWSpoJ%2BpvLR7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
