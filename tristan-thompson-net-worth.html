There’s definitely been a direct correlation between his proximity to the mega-wealthy Kardashian clan and his new-and-improved net worth. Back in 2018, sources from multiple outlets estimated the NBA champ’s net worth at around $8 million, compared to Khloé’s whopping net worth reaching the tens of millions."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But two years later, Tristan is already catching up.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/tristan-thompson.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/kylie-jenner-jordyn-woods-friends.jpg><p>Strangely enough, that’s still the case after his highly-publicized <a href=#>Jordyn Woods cheating scandal</a> in 2019 and a string of infidelities before that. For starters, Tristan broke things off with&nbsp;another&nbsp;Jordan, a.k.a. model Jordan Craig, right before getting into his relationship with Khloé in 2016. Craig was pregnant with his son at the time, but that didn’t stop the NBA star from starting things with Khloé.</p><p>By the time Khloé was pregnant herself with Tristan’s second child, True Thompson, the playboy was still up to his old tricks. Leaked footage from October 2017 showed Tristan cheating on Khloé with several different women all throughout the course of her pregnancy. Yet the Good American co-founder didn’t end things with her baby-daddy for good until he was caught kissing model and KarJenner squad member, Jordyn Woods, in February 2019. Kissing Jordyn, who was best friends with Khloé’s sister Kylie Jenner, was apparently the last straw.</p><p>Khloé confirmed she and Tristan were expecting a second child together in July 2022 via a statement from her representative. “We can confirm True will have a sibling who was conceived in November,” the statement read. “Khloé is incredibly grateful to the extraordinary surrogate for such a beautiful blessing. We’d like to ask for kindness and privacy so that Khloe can focus on her family.” A source also told&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Us Weekly</a>&nbsp;at the time, “Both baby and mother are very happy and healthy. Khloé is so thrilled to expand her family.” However, Khloé has full custody over her second child.</p><p>On January 22, 2024, the NBA announced that Tristan was suspended for drug use. According to the NBA, the Cavaliers center tested positive for ibutamoren, which is a growth hormone, and SARM LGD-4033, which is a non-steroid commonly used by bodybuilders and weightlifters for muscle enhancement. It’s unclear how long Thompson was utilizing the drugs and he’ll begin serving his suspension on January 24, 2024 for 25 games.</p><p>Before things get messy for the umpteenth time, let’s take a dive in to see where Tristan’s at financially—because let’s be real, we have to cover all our bases.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=what-is-tristan-thompson-s-net-worth>What is Tristan Thompson’s net worth?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/tristan-thompson.jpg><p><a href=# id=auto-tag_tristan-thompson data-tag=tristan-thompson>Tristan Thompson</a>‘s net worth in 2024 is estimated at $45 million, according to <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-athletes/nba/tristan-thompson-net-worth/ rel=nofollow>CelebrityNetWorth</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=how-much-money-does-tristan-thompson-make-from-the-nba>How much money does Tristan Thompson make from the NBA?</h2><p>Tristan’s latest contract deal with the Cleveland Cavaliers is a one year $3,196,448 contract. He signed a 5-year contract with the Cleveland Cavaliers back in 2015, IBT reported. According to his previous contract, Tristan was set to receive $18 million for the 2019-2020 season alone. Still, his contract includes a $82 million salary guarantee in total. In 2020, he signed a two-year, $18.9 million contract with the Boston Celtics. His one-year deal with the Los Angeles Lakers was worth just $16,700</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=how-does-tristan-thompson-spend-his-money>How does Tristan Thompson spend his money?</h2><p>While it’s no secret that Tristan’s a big spender (I mean, this is the same guy who got a <a href=#>luxury car for Koko</a> when he was trying to win her back), he does have his sights set on charitable efforts. In fact, Tristan is the founder of his own fund, which he started in honor of his younger brother. The Amari Thompson Fund supports epilepsy treatment for children diagnosed with the neurological disorder, which is the same one that causes Tristan’s own brother to experience seizures often.</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
