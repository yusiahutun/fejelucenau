Interestingly, they didn’t take the usual bachelorette party route, opting for something a little more extravagant. The bridal party and their significant others went to Europe for a “pre-moon” trip. They traveled to Spain and Italy before the men flew home and the ladies spent a few extra days in Ray’s home in Tuscany. (Talk about a great friend, right? That’s the kind of bridesmaid you want!)</p><p>“I don’t know if I would say it was very bachelorette-y, but it was exactly what I wanted,” Burrell <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">told People</a>. “I will give up a Vegas vacation to stuff my face full of carbonara in Rome any day of the week.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Rachael Ray Show (@rachaelrayshow)</a></p></figure><p>As you could expect, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the rest of the wedding</a>, which took place at Windridge Estates Redbarn 20 in Cazenovia, New York, was beautiful, too. The couple had a perfectly autumnal orange and white cake, a horse and carriage, and burnt orange bridesmaid dresses to fit the theme. “Everything was magical,” Burrell told <a href=#>Ray’s audience</a>. “It just felt like love.” Awwww.</p><p>These two have always had incredible chemistry onscreen when cooking together on the network, but it’s so wonderful to know they’re such close friends in real life, too!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfpby0wNJonKeslafBorXNppynrF%2BnrqS0wJ6jZqqRrnqius2eZJutoqeyrbiMsJydnJmjtA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
