Chatting to , Jo explained: "I would like to see people over the age of 80 in the show. I think that would be quite interesting for a change. I think it’s always nice to have a mixture, to be honest."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d170cdf2a3c2-gbbo-bakers-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eO7d16y1SVz data-wc=8><strong>This year's contestants were the youngest group ever</strong></p><p id=eHg7xTwXYvG data-wc=47>She continued: "Because I think old people, despite what most of society think, are actually fascinating. The older you are, the more experience you have to impart." This year's series was the youngest on record, which most contestants in their 20s with the oldest still only 56!</p><p id=e3D62Ma5he9m data-wc=1><strong>READ:<a class=hm-link href=#> Did the cinnamon-rolls on Bake Off leave you drooling?

A couple of them didn’t listen and I went over and taught the point again and again and again and again, and they still didn’t get it… There were times when there was a bit of a disaster on one of the technicals. I walked in and saw it and sort of had a go at them, which caused a little bit of emotion. Yes, I made them cry. They’re more pack animals now. Upset one and they all get upset. I think I hardened up a little bit this year actually." The semi-final, where airs on Tuesday, sees Steph Blackwell, 28, Alice Fevronia, 28, Rosie Brandreth-Poynter, 28, and David Atherton, 36, left to win the coveted glass cake plate ahead of next week's finale.
