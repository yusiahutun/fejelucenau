Finally, he and Alexandra open them and learn that his brother John has died.</p><h2>Brandon Sklenar kept these moments while filming ‘1923’</h2><p id=par-5_51>1923 is a period piece that takes place shortly after the end of WWI. During the first World War, letters were one of the only ways soldiers could stay in touch with their loved ones. 1923 star Brandon Sklenar appreciates many things about the time period this series takes place.</p><p id=par-6_49>“I’ve always had an affinity for the ’20s, just in general,” the actor told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Wrap</a>. “My great-grandfather fought in World War I, and I actually had his postcards that he wrote my great, great-grandmother when he was over there. I had them with me the whole time.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-7_64>“That little bit of Hemingway, a little bit of the postcards from my great grandfather, a little bit of Africa – you just draw inspiration wherever you can, really, and you’re sitting with the text as much as possible. And they’re going to have to figure out how this guy sounds, how he walks. How are you going to arc that over eight episodes?”</p><h2>Sklenar took inspiration from other decades for his character</h2><p id=par-8_23>Though Spencer Dutton is living through the ’20s in 1923, Brandon Sklenar also drew inspiration from several other decades for his character.</p><p id=par-9_59>“On the page, he’s more than just an archetype, but he’s reminiscent of these classic, iconic film, masculine archetypes that you would have seen in the ’30s, ’40s, ’50s, ’60s,” the actor told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Newsweek</a>. “He’s got a bit of that Clint Eastwood vibe. He’s got some Humphrey Bogart, it’s all kind of in there, and I think it resonates.”</p><p id=par-10_11>1923&nbsp;returns with episode 5 on Sunday, Feb. 5, only on Paramount+.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGR%2Ben6SZpmrmZ6ZvK950qSjnqaRp3qssc%2BtZKKloKS%2Fta3NrWSmp52au7W70madoqSdnruoesetpKVn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
