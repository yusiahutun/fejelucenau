Monroe embraced femininity to the fullest by wearing form-fitting hourglass silhouettes, rich hues, and necklines that plunged into daring terrain.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Many moments throughout her film career have left a lasting impression on fashion, thanks to her collaboration with famed costume designer William Travilla. These include the famous cotton candy pink gown and matching opera gloves she wore in "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes," the white halter dress from "The Seven Year Itch" that beautifully billowed once she stepped upon a subway grate, and the bawdy western saloon style she donned in "River of No Return."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Even her off-screen outfits have made an impression. Monroe never fell for fashion fads and instead gravitated towards a classic, minimalist wardrobe built around capri pants, boatneck shirts, duster coats, and chic sheath dresses. Her effortless ability to go from full-on glitz to barefoot in jeans is the style duality that has made Marilyn Monroe's outfits such conversation starters even after decades have passed.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_4-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ahead,&nbsp;we examine the outfits that made this silver screen siren a fashion icon for the ages.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-promotional-portrait-1946></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Promotional Portrait, 1946</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Before she was known as Marilyn Monroe, she was Norma Jean Baker. In 1946, the aspiring actress set out on a path to become America's sweetheart and was photographed in a series of promotional photos throughout 1946 and 1947 that captured her wholesome allure. One of the most famous looks from those photos was her candy cane-striped bikini, which complemented her strawberry blonde locks.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-promotional-photo-1947></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Promotional Photo, 1947</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Once she adopted her Hollywood moniker, Monroe continued to shoot promotional portraits in more conservative attire like this seafoam blue chiffon gown with blooming embroidery spread throughout. Monroe's earlier, more modest wardrobe and natural looks in these photos served as an interesting contrast to the bombastic looks and manicured beauty she flaunted later on in her career.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-idaho-potato-sack-1951></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Idaho Potato Sack, 1951</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After she received criticism from a journalist who disapproved of a sultry red dress Monroe wore, going as far as to say that even a potato sack would have looked better. Monroe's film studio, Twentieth Century Fox, took advantage of the negative press and arranged a photo shoot where Monroe wore just that: a potato sack. Proving that the actress would look radiant no matter what she wore.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-marry-a-millionaire-1953></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Marry a Millionaire, 1953</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The actress solidified her stardom with her acclaimed role in the comedy film How to Marry a Millionaire, in which she wore a plethora of awe-inspiring gowns custom-made for her by costume designer William Travilla. One of the standout costumes from the film was this ruched gown bonded by a beaded belt and asymmetrical strap, which Monroe donned with the utmost confidence - a characteristic that would become paramount to her style.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-marry-a-millionaire-premiere-party-1953></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Marry a Millionaire Premiere Party, 1953</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Monroe continued to serve golden-era glamour while at the premiere party of "How To Marry A Millionaire," wearing a strapless dress and stole, which would later become a winning style combo for the actress. The lace detailing of this look is perfectly offset by the shining satin sash and matching gloves that add an air of regalness to the otherwise sultry ensemble.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-gentlemen-prefer-blondes-1953></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, 1953</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">One of Monroe's most iconic looks is undoubtedly the cotton candy pink gown she wore in the 1953 musical "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes." In the film, Monroe saunters about in this ravishing number while exclaiming that "diamonds are a girl's best friend," a sight that has become seared in the minds of many for its outlandish opulence. This look has become so iconic that it has spawned countless reincarnations from Madonna's "Material Girl" music video to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Ryan Gosling's performance of "I'm Just Ken" at the 2024 Oscars</a>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-frank-povolny-portrait-1953></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Frank Povolny Portrait, 1953</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Photographer Frank Povolny captured the golden glow of Monroe's stunning beauty in their 1953 portrait session. Set against a stark black background, the goddess gown highlighted the inviting warmth of Monroe's presence and also fit her like a glove. Plunging necklines and pleated skirts would go on to be stylish spotlights in Monroe's fashions.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-rallying-the-troops-1954></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Rallying the Troops, 1954</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Monroe cemented her place in the hearts of Americans nationwide during the Korean War when she embarked on a four-day tour, during which she performed ten shows in front of audiences totaling over 100,000 soldiers and marines. These performances showcased a myriad of beaded sheath dresses like the purple number seen above. The images of Monroe rallying the troops became a beacon of beauty and hope for many.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-river-of-no-return-1954></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>River of No Return, 1954</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Playing a goodhearted barroom singer&nbsp;in the Western thriller "River of No Return," Monroe had the opportunity to get laced up in more jaw-dropping outfits from the mind of William Travilla. Monroe's wardrobe of stylish saloon looks was a masterclass of design that pushed the limits of what Western wear could be, as seen in this green velvet corseted gown with jet-black beading and red ruffled crinoline underskirt.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-seven-year-itch-1955></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Seven Year Itch, 1955</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Undoubtedly, one of Monroe's most famous outfits was the all-white ensemble she wore in "The Seven Year Itch," which featured the dress. It makes its grand appearance as Monroe and her on-screen co-star Richard Sherman leave a movie theater, and once they hear a subway train passing below the sidewalk grate, she steps on it and asks, "Ooh, do you feel the breeze from the subway?" as the wind sends the dress billowing up teasing viewers with a flirty glimpse of her legs. The Travilla-designed frock is one of the few articles of clothing that has its very own Wikipedia page due to the sheer impact that the look had on society and pop culture on a worldwide level.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-married-life-1956></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Married Life, 1956</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Monroe adopted a chic collection of separates to wear in her off-screen life that offered a more approachable image of the blonde bombshell. These rare moments of Monroe living out her day-to-day life, while looking impossibly good gave the star a relatable visage and inspired many who gazed upon her off-duty outfits also to put more effort into their attire.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-some-like-it-hot-1958></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Some Like It Hot, 1958</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For her role in "Some Like It Hot," Monroe was dressed by Australian-American Hollywood costume designer Orry-Kelly — a rare departure from her stylish partnership with Travella. The costumes in the film featured heavy embellishments and sheer silhouettes that certainly pushed the envelope at the time, such as this champagne-sequined gown that featured a neckline that left little to the imagination.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-jetsetting-1961></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Jetsetting, 1961</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When she wasn't performing on-screen, Monroe constantly balanced glamour and relatable charm with her outfits. Although many of her clothes skimmed her body in a sensuous manner, she still gave off an heir of sophistication with her outerwear and tailoring. This jersey dress and printed trench coat she wore to jet set to New York from Los Angeles is the perfect embodiment of her street style.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-happy-birthday-mr-president-1962></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Happy Birthday, Mr. President, 1962</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">One of the last iconic looks of Monroe's is the Jean Louis design she wore to sing "Happy Birthday" to then President John F. Kennedy at Madison Square Garden. The dress was rendered in a sheer nude fabric and shimmered with hundreds of hand-sewn sequins splattered about. The moment for Monroe became one of grand notoriety, or infamy depending on who you ask, and the Louis dress took on a life of its own after Monroe's death, having had many owners first being sold for $1.26 million at a 1999 auction and then sold to Ripley’s Believe It or Not for a whopping $4.8 million. The dress found itself in the headlines once again when it was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>controversially worn by Kim Kardashian to the Met Gala in 2022</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zJqpoqSpo3quu82rpp5ln6rBp7XTrGRxbmJthHF%2B</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
