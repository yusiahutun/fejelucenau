Hello Tristan! Good day to you, Mrs Pumphrey — and, especially, welcome to Tricki Woo. Two episodes in, the essential cast of All Creatures Great And Small (C5) are all in place.
Though his fringe is less extravagantly floppy than his predecessor Peter Davison's, Callum Woodhouse is the perfect actor to play Siegfried Farnon's boozy reprobate of a little brother, Tristan."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The stories haven't been updated or imbued with 21st-century morals, and the nearest they came to being 'sexed up' was a moment at the start when farmer's daughter Helen (Rachel Shenton) caught a glimpse of our hero swimming naked beneath a waterfall.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Next time she saw him, she called out cheekily: 'Didn't recognise you with your clothes on!' How the poor lad blushed.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Dame Diana Rigg is wonderful as the grand Mrs Pumphrey. In the original TV series, 40 years ago, she was played by Margaretta Scott as a rather woolly-headed woman, slightly deaf and forgetful.</p><h2>RELATED ARTICLES</h2><ul class="rotator-pages link-xocc"><li class=rotator-prev><a href=# data-page=prev>Previous</a></li><li><a href=# data-page=1>1</a></li><li class=rotator-next><a href=# data-page=next>Next</a></li></ul><ul class="rotator-panels link-bogr1 linkro-ccox"><li><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/09/09/01/32942114-0-image-m-15_1599610917898.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>Jackie 'O' Henderson and Osher Günsberg avoid hotel...</span></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/09/09/00/32941360-0-image-m-18_1599609331592.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>'It was like being electronically raped': Paris Hilton...</span></a></li></ul><h2>Share this article</h2><span class=wai>Share</span><p class=mol-para-with-font>If there is anything woolly about Dame Diana, it's wire wool — the sort that can easily remove a layer of skin. Her Mrs P had no time for Tristan's flatteries, and although she invited young vet James (Nicholas Ralph) to her soiree, she didn't dream he was good enough to mingle with her guests — he was simply there to mind the dog.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But what a dog. Tricki Woo is a long-haired Pekingese who lives on caviar, roast beef, trifle and brandy. Evidently he is a creature of refined taste, though gluttony plays havoc with his digestion — a condition his owner referred to in the books as 'going flop-bott'.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>With his usual dry humour, Herriot explained in his memoirs why Tricki was such a valued client of the veterinary practice in Skeldale: 'When he went to the seaside, he sent me boxes of oak-smoked kippers; when the tomatoes ripened in the greenhouse, he sent me a pound or two each week.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'But it was when the Christmas hamper arrived from Fortnum & Mason's that I realised I was on to a really good thing.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The good graces of a dog are worth cultivating — something our ancestors understood. Dog Tales: The Making Of Man's Best Friend (BBC4) traced the story of how we befriended and tamed our mutts over tens of thousands of years.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The alliance appears to be largely their choice. Clever as the domestic dog is, wild wolves are smarter, one scientist in Austria explained. They looked at early humans and decided to make allies of us.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Perhaps the most interesting segment of the documentary was also the most difficult to watch.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>An experiment with thousands of foxes in Russia has shown that, within ten generations of selective breeding, animals can be reared that are as affectionate as dogs.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>These foxes roll over to have their tummies tickled and even wag their tails. A scientist scooped one up to cuddle it and said in broken English, 'impossible not love them'.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Quite true. But to see fields of the poor creatures in tiny wire cages was horrible.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKymqLWww8GisWiZoqm2pLjEZm9waWJmgXp7s6GcZp%2Bimq61sdKtZKylkaG5bq%2FRnpitraKaeqSt1aKYq2WcpMOqusZmi6uhk6C2bqPOqGWhrJ2h</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
