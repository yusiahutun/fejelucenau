News</strong></a> in her first interview about the controversy. "I've just been so busy traveling around the country with press that I haven't really been able to read too much up on it, but everyone is entitled to their own opinions, and at the end of the day I wanted to go on this journey to open up myself and have people see my love story unfold and I would hope that they would stay open and respect me but also stay open and respect these 28 guys that went along on the journey with me."</p><p>Becca told <a href=#><strong>Entertainment Tonight</strong></a> that if the allegations against Garret are true, she would "confront" the situation.</p><p>"We would have a discussion about it. We would get to the bottom of it and we would find a solution," she said. "I can't fault on anyone for what they believe and who's to say that anyone is truly what they believe in if they just double tap. I can't speak to that because that's just not me. I am a strong woman and I do believe in certain things, but again, that's what's so great about our country -- everyone is entitled to their own opinions."</p><p>"I did things in the past that I'm sure wasn't the best thing, but I just want people to stay open-minded to everyone," she added.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:f1fa18b2-6377-5a0f-b2d6-b8f7d1db1dd5 data-container-ref=toofab:article:b91a01c6-3430-53ef-8175-b99f299fcb38 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/61/5by4/2018/05/29/61089f56f7a85ce3b7a98bd8de69b275_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">ABC</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Rose Red Flags: 'Bachelorette' Becca Kufrin Gets Cozy With a Chris Farley Impersonator, a Chicken and Cologne Addict in Season Premiere</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Speaking with E!, Kufrin also talked about how "different" it is to start dating all these men without getting a peek at their social media pages first.</p><p>"It's different, but it's nice in a way, because I was truly getting to know these guys for them, and have conversations face to face with them about things that were important to me," she continued. "So I feel like I got a much better picture of who these 28 guys were, as opposed to just looking on their social media and trying to make a decision of who they were by not talking to them."</p><p>While fans will have to wait until the finale to see if Garrett wins the final rose -- a prediction Jimmy Kimmel made on his show last night -- we do know she is currently engaged.</p><p>"The Bachelorette" airs Monday nights at 8 p.m. on ABC.</p><a class="media-link image-block__link js-track-link" href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/53/o/2018/05/21/530ed8c6b2dc56bb80c27b6ca4d8fa26_md.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="media-credit image-block__media-credit">Mexico News</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlfnl7j25mbGhfrLWiwIybmJyglaG8s7HTrZxmmpWYsKJ5yq6dq6GeYrWisIytpmarka56oq7Orqtmn5Gnv6bA02awq6GXpMamutJmmqimpKe8t7HRrKCapF2ovKS1wKVkpp2Unq5uvM6sq6xn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
