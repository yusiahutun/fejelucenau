The 2024 Ninja 500 and Z 500 have made their official debut, ushering in a new era for the middleweight sport and naked motorcycle categories.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Evolution of Kawasaki’s Eliminator</h2><p>While Kawasaki’s Eliminator cruiser series has been well-received, it was only in early 2023 that Team Green introduced a slightly larger-displacement version. In the United States, it is simply known as the Eliminator, as the 400cc version available in other markets wasn’t offered there. However, in regions where the 400cc variant was available, it was distinguished as the Eliminator 500 to clarify the difference.</p><p>This 451cc engine that powered the enhanced Eliminator now serves as the heart of the new Ninja 500 and Z 500, marking an exciting development for these models.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Meet the 2024 Ninja 500 and Z 500</h2><p>The 2024 Kawasaki Ninja 500 and Z 500 share the same power source, a liquid-cooled, dual overhead cam, eight-valve, 451cc parallel <a href=#>twin engine</a>. The engine boasts a 70mm by 58.6mm bore and stroke and features a compression ratio of 11.3 to one. It delivers an impressive 33.4 kilowatts, which translates to just under 45 horsepower at 9,000 rpm, along with 42.6 newton-meters, approximately 31.4 pound-feet, of torque at an undisclosed RPM. Both motorcycles come equipped with a smooth-shifting six-speed gearbox.</p><p>In terms of design, both the 2024 <a href=# rel=noopener>Ninja 500 and Z 500</a> adopt a steel trellis frame for a strong and lightweight foundation. The suspension comprises a 41mm nonadjustable telescopic front fork and a rear shock setup with preload adjustability, providing a comfortable and responsive ride. Braking performance is delivered through a two-piston caliper and a single semi-floating disc at the front, while the rear features a two-piston caliper and a single disc setup. Both motorcycles ride on 17-inch alloy wheels.</p><p>As for the aesthetics, the 2024 Kawasaki Ninja 500 will be available in the stylish Metallic Spark Black and Metallic Flat Raw Graystone color scheme. Meanwhile, the 2024 Kawasaki Z500 will come in the eye-catching Metallic Spark Black and Metallic Matte Graphenesteel Gray color scheme.</p><p>While pricing for the 2024 Ninja 500 and Z 500 has not been officially disclosed, it is expected to be announced soon and will vary by region.</p><p>It’s important to note that, as of now, both the 2024 Ninja 500 and Z 500 have been confirmed for the European market. While Kawasaki has not announced their availability in other regions, it is likely that these exciting models will be introduced in additional markets in the near future, expanding the reach of these impressive motorcycles. Kawasaki enthusiasts worldwide can look forward to experiencing the power and style of these new additions to the Ninja and Z lineups.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqyr8DEq6eroaOaxLC%2By51lnKedZLuqusmaZG5oYGKur7CMs2RuaGBixKrAx2arsKGeYrKvs8innA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
