Tamar Braxton clearly had nothing to hide when she stepped on stage for &#34;The Wendy Williams Show&#34; today.
Sporting nothing but a pair of Spanx, Braxton opened up about her self esteem issues, before an incredibly candid interview touching on her relationship with her ex-husband, his friendship with Wendy's ex and her issues with her famous family and former costars on &#34;"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Explaining her unconventional look, Tamar said today would be the "last day wearing Spanx for life," as part of a major lifestyle change.</p><p>"Period. I'm done," she continued. "Everybody talking about Hot Girl Summer, I'm lying, I had a Warm Girl Summer with a filter. I'm not doing that no more, I can't. My stomach is having several seats on my lap. I can't live my life like this."</p><p>As a shocked Wendy looked on, Tamar added, "I gotta feel physically amazing to be mentally amazing and I'm not there." Pledging to take part in a 30 day transformation, she said, "under my clothes I want to feel amazing and I want to feel amazing no matter what. Here is the thing sis, when you don't feel physically good, your mental is all jacked up."</p><p>"I challenge myself to become my best self. Period," she continued, saying this decision "came to fruition" in the last 48 hours. "I just got tired of stuffing my stomach in my pants. Why we sitting around here fronting and lying about, 'I feel amazing,' you do not feel amazing after you eat burger, pizza, fries and three martinis like I like to eat -- don't judge me! -- I'm just saying. I just feel like God has a lot in store for me ... I want to be mentally ready for it."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:b91c9a16-14b1-5cd2-b233-b29921f173b6 data-container-ref=toofab:article:8c448219-7d02-5979-a760-c51e536ac873 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/db/5by4/2019/09/17/db3bd9cac1c456ed95c9f4fed10b66fe_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Fox</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Wendy Williams and NeNe Leakes Throw Shade at Each Other</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>She said her boyfriend, David Adefeso, was also on board for the challenge. Of her man, she added, "that's a piece of chocolate I won't be giving up" -- and said she'd marry him if he asked.</p><p>Talk than shifted to Vince Hebert, who she split from in 2017. "My relationship did not fail because of a reality show," Tamar told Wendy. "My relationship failed because of lies and deceit. Vince and I have always been and will always remain friends. I had to jump over the hurdles because it's a process to get back to being friends."</p><p>Apparently Tamar's ex is still friendly with Wendy William's ex, Kevin Hunter, saying she thinks it's "great" they're close. "I think they can learn a lot from each other," she added. "They should start a First Husband's Club. That's not shade!"</p><p>Of her show, "Braxton Family Values," being renewed following some serious drama last season, Braxton said she hoped for smoother sailing in the new episodes.</p><p>"What I'm hoping for, my prayer this year is for things to not be as combative as they were and things to be shown in the light they actually were shot in," she said. "Here is the thing, let's just say we had a conversation -- like the conversation we just had about our exes -- people could edit it where we are going all the way in on them. That's how it's been done these past four seasons."</p><p>She added she was excited for sister Trina's upcoming wedding.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:532a965a-2e34-5b75-a8a4-aaf7757c622e data-container-ref=toofab:article:8c448219-7d02-5979-a760-c51e536ac873 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/77/5by4/2019/03/08/7759ceb890985fa39c6aa448f33558ce_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Fox/Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Tamar Braxton 'Floored' By Lindsay Lohan Tweets, Dina Says She Never Sent Them</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Wendy ended the interview by once again bringing up her unexpected exit from "The Real" in 2016, when her contract wasn't renewed. "They need you and you were done dirty," said Williams.</p><p>"I love you. Here is the thing. I don't wanna be anybody's marketing tool this season, no shade, I just wish everybody well," she said. "I feel like sometimes God has to move you out of situations before you become more toxic to yourself. What if I was in the situation where I'm doing the Braxtons and it's very stressful and I'm doing this other show where people are being catty behind my back, what kind of person would I be right now sitting on this couch?</p><p>"I wouldn't be focused, I wouldn't be ready for my transformation, I wouldn't be ready for my elevation and that's where I got to go," she added. "I gotta go up and up and up."</p><p>Braxton continued to open up more about how she had "completely let [herself] go" and her goals on Instagram following the show:</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlfnp7j3JmanBfqa6urdFmmauZqKm8r3nSqZinsF2ssq%2Bw2GauoqScnq6uv4ysn6ivXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
