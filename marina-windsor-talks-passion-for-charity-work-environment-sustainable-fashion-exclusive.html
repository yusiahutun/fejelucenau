I try to shop from charity shops, vintage shops, sustainable brands, and often I borrow clothes off friends. That's a pretty good way of doing it. That's what my friends and I are trying to do a lot more.

I wish I could do it all over again," she says. "It's such a privilege to travel and to be able to see beautiful parts of the world and to see how amazing this planet is.

"The bucket list always changes," she laughs. "I would love to go to Mongolia, to Iceland to see the Icelandic ponies, to Indonesia, and to the Philippines. We've got some amazing projects all around the world and so I learn about different places I'd like to visit through that a lot."</p><p id=eB72L6l5STS2 data-wc=19>Despite a passion for travelling, Marina is very much a homebird at heart. London is her home for now.</p><p id=eYDPhFUyCDMM data-wc=48>"For now, I'm grateful for and enjoying the gift of being near friends and family.

I'd followed them for a while from a distance; incidentally, when I was at Big Give, they would take part in the Green Match Fund campaigns, so I got to know them a bit more through that and just always really admired the work they did.
