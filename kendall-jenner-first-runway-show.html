The 26-year-old model made her high fashion debut in 2014 for Marc Jacobs at the young age of 18, rocking a completely sheer top on the runway. For the show, she was dressed in a light taupe colored long-sleeve shirt which was completely see-though, paired with high water trousers and a short red bob with bleached eyebrows."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

For the show, she was dressed in a light taupe colored long-sleeve shirt which was completely see-though, paired with high water trousers and a short red bob with bleached eyebrows.</p><p>Though she was a little nervous about her first show, she revealed in a new video with Vogue that her concerns had nothing to do with her near-toplessness.</p><p>"I had just turned 18. I remember getting a call from my agent saying that Marc [Jacobs] and Katie wanted to put me in this kind of sheer top," she recalled. "And I was like, I'm game like, I don't mind like, I'm all good with the nipples so it didn't make me any more nervous."</p><p>"I genuinely was just like dope!" she said with a laugh. "Whatever they want, it's their vision so let's do it. I was completely comfortable."</p><p>Instead, she was actually nervous about her footwear for the runway.</p><p>"I weirdly had little nerves and I think it was because my shoes were relatively flat. They weren't some big tall heel. I was pretty chill --- even though my boobies were out,” she said.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:ba8a9105-a415-4482-9e4f-d3e2a163b31b data-container-ref=toofab:article:bd1a5c51-59dd-4b7e-9089-3212dd369662 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/3b/5by4/2022/09/22/3b3841e441bf41f38a7f64b3b6228c51_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Hulu</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Kardashians Premiere Details Tristan's Paternity Scandal and Birth of Khloe's Second Baby</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>While she's a seasoned pro on the catwalk now, Kendall recalled looking a little stiff at first -- admitting she "didn't necessarily know what I was doing" at the time.</p><p>"I remember going into my agency and kind of getting like a walking lesson because I didn't necessarily know what I was doing," she said.
