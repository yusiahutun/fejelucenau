1Swap Costa Rica for BelizeGettyCosta Rica is known for its outdoor adventure, beautiful beaches and colourful wildlife, but without the crowds then Belize is a good alternative. This pint-sized country with a population of only 380,000 boasts great swathes of rainforest, exotic wildlife and the world’s second largest barrier reef. Belize is also known as the epicentre of the ancient Maya world, and Mayan Cities including Xunantunich are located in the jungle areas which can be reached by a horseback ride through private farms and along the Mopan River."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

What it lacks in lavender fields and bling, it makes up for with authenticity, pretty villages (Aiguèze, Montclus and La Roque-sur-Cèze have repeatedly been named three of the most picturesque villages in France), sandy, unspoilt beaches (Hemingway was a big fan of Le Grau-du-Roi), affordable markets frequented by actual locals and the Pont du Gard, a Roman aqueduct that is as awe-inspiring now and it must have been when it was first created.

Those searching for similar levels of picturesque vistas, excellent food and a bustling harbour should turn to Hydra, a Greek island two hours by boat from Athens port. Although it might have become popular with creative, bohemian types back in the 60s (Leonard Cohen and his Marianne lived here for years), its lost none of its appeal. Hydra has been compared to a mini St-Tropez, but the absence of roads on the island has stopped investors from building it up too much. In fact, the only way to get around is by boat or by donkey. The horse-shoe shaped, marble-paved harbour boasts cafes and bars, as well as chic interiors and fashion boutiques. Its stupidly beautiful alcoves make home for small, often remote beaches, sometimes with a taverna ready to watch the sunset with a cold beer in hand. Hydra's cliffs are dotted with restaurants and bars where locals spill out from sundown until dawn, sometimes cooling off with midnight dips into the sea.

It's been compared to Ibiza back when it was still a bohemian haven, but Comporta has a unique appeal, characterised by its untouched sandy beaches, cheerful fields of poppies and yellow wildflowers. Small, low-built, thatched cabanas, candy-striped beach huts and wild dolphins have attracted an elegant fan base, including Philippe Starck, Christian Louboutin and Farida Khelfa. Expect a mix of chic beach-focused boutiques alongside a splattering of rustic coastal dining spots, offering jumbo-sized prawns and jugs of sangria.

Once the preserve of Spring Breakers wanting to party by the beach, Fort Lauderdale has a lot more than meets the eye. Sure its sunny climes and pristine beaches are attractive, but the city's fine dining scene, outdoor art galleries and freshwater lagoon make it an enticing proposition.

Despite its expansive size, the city feels easy to explore and get to know. The Paseo del Rio - more commonly known as the Riverwalk - was seemingly built for sunshine strolling along narrow paths down a 15-mile stretch of the city’s river, while listening to Tejano music that blares from bars and local homes. Tejano like Tex-Mex food is a fusion of Mexican and Texan culture, a defining characteristic of San Antonio – and it’s this multiculturalism that give it such soul. Its Day of the Dead celebrations are the biggest outside Mexico, with numerous costume parades, live music, shrines and packed food markets dotted around the city.

The Amalfi coast is unarguably beautiful, but for a lesser-known slice of la dolce vita heads to the fishing village of Camogli, tucked into a thyme-scented hillside in Liguria in Northern Italy. Just two hours from Milan, the colourful cluster of historic tenements have been a closely-guarded holiday destination of the Italians for years. Situated on the Riviera di Levante not far from glittering Portofino, Camogli is chraracterised by its laidback spirit and its high-stacked painted building which overlook the ocean. There's not a great deal to do other than to explore the empty paths lined by olive and lemon trees, to breathe in the rosemary-filled air and to eat pasta by the harbour as the sun sets over the lighthouse. Bliss.

Hotel numbers are restricted, construction is controlled and nightlife is laidback with a hippy appeal. The island's website describes it as “the last paradise of the Mediterranean”, and given its sand dune-lined, pristine beaches, whitewashed villages and tranquil atmosphere, we're inclined to agree. Its flat terrain, covered in olive groves, makes it perfect to explore by bike before you wind up back on the beach for a sundowner.
