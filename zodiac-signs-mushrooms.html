Since the beginning of time, mushrooms have been associated with fairies, elves, and tales of mythical creatures, enchanting us mortals every step of the way.</p><p>Whenever I think of mushrooms, I think of their perspective in <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>the Sylvia Plath poem</a>: “Overnight, very / Whitely, discreetly, / Very quietly / Our toes, our noses / Take hold on the loam, / Acquire the air.” The eerie patience and simplicity of each line resembles the quiet fortitude of the mushroom; a fungal body that does not make a sound, yet multiplies faster than an unstoppable army. Taking over what has been long since been abandoned, mushrooms <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>rise from decaying organic matter</a>, doing a job few are willing to do. And it is because of their willingness to “diet on water” and “crumbs of shadow” that they can succeed in secret and side-step you when you’re not looking.</p><p>Mushrooms <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">can enchant you</a>, nourish you, poison you, and even kill you. And if you’re not paying attention, you may grab the wrong one. Sylvia concludes her poem: “We shall by morning / Inherit the earth. / Our foot’s in the door.” Mushrooms may not find you, but you most definitely will find them. And by the time you do, they may have already taken over.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Copy-of-List-Redirect-Design-19-1.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=the-mushroom-that-captures-each-zodiac-sign>The Mushroom That Captures Each Zodiac Sign</h2><p>Like mushrooms that multiply by the hour, you, too, have an ability to dominate the world in secret and make the impossible possible. And with that in mind, here is the mushroom that most accurately <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>reflects your zodiac sign</a>:</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5><h2>Aries: You're Death Cap</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1422824496.jpg><p>Despite their fierce reputation, Aries often doesn’t seem intimidating on the surface. You may even find them innocent and completely approachable, as they are the first sign in the zodiac, making them the “infants” of astrology. However, like the death cap mushroom, looks can be very deceiving. Let’s not forget Aries is ruled by Mars—planet of war and combat—and death cap mushroom is the most poisonous and dangerous mushroom for human consumption. And although the death cap mushroom appears entirely innocuous, it is also responsible for around 90 percent of mushroom-related deaths. Aries always loves dominating the playing field.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2><h2>Taurus: You're Truffles</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1365364797.jpg><p>Taurus is ruled by extravagant Venus, planet of luxury and pleasure, which is why it comes as no surprise they would be the most expensive mushroom of all—the truffle. This is essentially the caviar of the mushroom world, making them perfect for a Taurus that often has high standards. Truffles also have just as tough of an exterior as earth sign Taurus, as they literally crack open like hard-shelled nuts upon reaching their full size and grows through a symbiotic relationship with tree roots. And because Taurus loves to take their time and move at their own pace, they can relate to the way it takes around 7 to 10 years for this fungus to finally produce fruiting bodies.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5><h2>Gemini: You’re Ghost Fungus</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1188626849.jpg><p>There’s always two sides of the coin when it comes to Gemini, as this fringe air sign exists in liminal spaces. The Omphalotus nidiformis—aka “ghost fungus”—may appear as an ordinary cluster of white mushrooms, but they emit a blue-green bioluminescence in lowlight conditions. Even in total darkness, a Gemini feels the need to balance it out with some light, and vice versa. Gemini also loves inspiring ideas and curiosity, as the ghost fungus has boggled and enchanted even some of the greatest minds in human history. Both Aristotle and Pliny the Elder marveled at their alien glow. From Scandinavia to Indonesia, humans have also used these as glowing torches throughout history.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.5><h2>Cancer: You’re Devil’s Tooth</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Hydnellum_peckii2.jpeg><p>To its core, Cancer is a witchy and temperamental water sign that contains just as many phases as the moon. And the gooey red liquid substance that oozes out of a Hydnellum peckii—a.k.a. “Devil’s tooth”—when its roots are too wet looks straight out of a dark fairy tale. How fitting for your mysterious beauty. Cancer is also naturally feisty and defensive, which is reflected in the velvety white prongs that cover this fungus like millions of tiny teeth. And like the Cancer’s desire to forge deep roots, the Devil’s tooth mushroom has an interconnected network of mycelia that extends beneath the forest floor, reaching up to eleven feet away from the mushroom itself.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4><h2>Leo: You’re Fly Agaric</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1746898302.jpg><p>The fly agaric—a.k.a. Amanita muscaria—is probably the most popular and recognizable mushroom of all, which is exactly how a Leo likes to be seen. With its signature bright red-orange cap that’s speckled with a polka-dot of white warts, the fly agaric brings you back to folk lore, Brother’s Grimm, and spooky tales of trickster fairies. This meshes with the bright light of expressive Leo, because this fixed fire sign is also associated with the inner child. And because Leo loves seeing the world in technicolor, it comes as no surprise that fly agaric does, in fact, contain a mildly poisonous hallucinogen. However, I still wouldn’t step into a fairy ring of fly agaric if I were you.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.5><h2>Virgo: You’re Chicken of the Woods</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1447321356.jpg><p>Virgo is the zodiac sign of health, nourishment, and resourcefulness, which captures the hearty and flavorful chicken of the woods. Forming along deciduous trees such as oak, beech, chestnut, and cherry, this yummy and nutritious edible mushroom is considered a delicacy with its meaty texture that resembles chicken or lobster drizzled in lemon juice. A potent source of antioxidants, chicken of the woods is a popular mushroom to forage, matching Virgo’s hunter-gatherer energy. Virgo always inspires one to search deeper and find answers, which is exactly what it takes to find chicken of the woods.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.5><h2>Libra: You're Pink Oyster</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1356210820-copy.jpg><p>Libra is one of the most graceful, artful, and romantic of all zodiac signs. And the pink oyster resembles a feathery and bright bouquet of flowers more than a moist cluster of fungi, meshing with this Venus-ruled zodiac sign’s whole vibe. And because Libra is the zodiac sign of balance and diplomacy, you’ll find that pink oysters are more than just aesthetically pleasing; they’re also high in protein, fibers, minerals, and carbohydrates. However, that doesn’t take away from the fact that the pink oyster mushroom also has the most flirtatious scientific name of all time—Pleurotus djamor.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5><h2>Scorpio: You’re Cordyceps</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1209348742.jpg><p>Scorpio is the zodiac sign of merging energies and transformation, accurately describing the way the killer fungus cordyceps operates. Portrayed as the cause of the zombie apocalypse in the show The Last of Us, cordyceps grows by taking over the bodies of insects, namely caterpillars. Ironically, this is also how they get their superfood qualities. After all, cordyceps is known for its powerful anti-cancer properties that can shrink tumors. It captures the paradox of the Scorpio experience—that destruction paves the way for creation and death can also help sustain life. Everything is a cycle, which is exemplified by both cordyceps and Scorpio.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2><h2>Sagittarius: You’re the Giant Puffball</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1614073239.jpg><p>Expansive fire sign Sagittarius always find a way to make waves, just like the giant puffball has become the latest TikTok obsession. As foragers film themselves searching for the large and spongy puffball, there’s no doubt Calvatia gigantea takes gatherers on an adventure. Sagittarius is always interested in discovering something new, and because they’re ruled by gas-giant Jupiter, they can relate to the way this large and substantial fungus takes up space. The more is always the merrier where Sagittarius is involved, as the edible giant puffball can be sliced into thick slivers and cooked to perfection.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5><h2>Capricorn: You’re Lion’s Mane</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-867110622-copy.jpg><p>There’s no mushroom more regal than lion’s mane and no zodiac sign more concerned with standards and prestige than Capricorn. Lion’s mane contains anti-aging properties that prevents dementia, lessens depression, and increases the growth of brain cells, which is one reason why historically lion’s mane was only reserved for royalty and considered sacred to Buddhist monks. Like Capricorn, Lion’s mane is a survivor, and this icicle of fungus forms from dead organic matter like wood. Adding lion’s mane to your diet will improve your memory and clear your brain fog, which is exactly what a Capricorn needs to keep up with their daily hustle.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.5><h2>Aquarius: You’re Turkey Tail</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-521185652.jpg><p>Aquarius is a beautiful, eccentric, and often misunderstood fixed air sign that always finds a way to stand out from the crowd, much like the beauty of turkey tail mushroom. These fungal clusters fan out with alternating rows of bright stripes and although they’re edible, they’re leathery and hard-to-chew, which reflects the way Aquarius energy is not for everyone. However, what Aquarius brings to the table is also extremely necessary, just like the way turkey tail—a.k.a. Trametes versicolor—is famed for the way it boosts immunity and fosters healthy cellular activity. After all, Aquarius rules over the circulatory system.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3><h2>Pisces: You’re Magic Mushrooms</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1363259974.jpg><p>Dreamy water sign Pisces loves wading through other realms and swimming through otherworldly lagoons. Its modern planetary ruler is literally Neptune, planet of fantasy and illusion. And if one were to ingest a Psilocybin mushroom—a.k.a. a “magic mushroom”—they would experience hallucinogenic effects that alter their senses, distort their emotions, and cause them to see or hear things that may not really be there. Pisces, too, often has trouble deciphering where the truth begins and ends. Down the rabbit hole is where you’ll often find Pisces, but it’s also where you should beware, as it can also bring you more wisdom than you’ve truly earned.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astrologynewslettersignup.png></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfr7yltcCcZKyhl6PAbrnUrJ%2Brp5%2BiwHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
