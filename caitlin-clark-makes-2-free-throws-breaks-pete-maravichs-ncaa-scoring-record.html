Best known for her long 3-point shots, she instead went past Maravich after Ohio State was called for a technical foul with less than a second to go in the first half.</p><p>Clark swished both free throws to run her career total to 3,668 points; she had no immediate reaction after the second shot went through, as if it hadn’t sunk in yet.</p><a href=# class=promo-link__link>LeBron James reaches 40,000 points, extends his NBA career scoring record</a><p>Asked in a television interview at halftime if she was aware of the record when she stepped to the line, Clark said: “Not really. When they announced it and everybody screamed, that’s when I knew.”</p><p>Clark got off to a slow start. Her first shot was a 3-pointer that bounced off the rim. She missed a layup and from deep on the right wing before making a 3 from the left side for her first basket.</p><p>After starting 2 for 7, she made 3 of her next 4 shots — including three straight 3-pointers, each deeper than the previous.</p><p>Woodard was among the attendees at Carver-Hawkeye Arena to help Clark celebrate senior day. Also on hand were basketball great Maya Moore, who was Clark’s favorite player, and Baseball Hall of Fame pitcher Nolan Ryan.</p><ul class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_swiper-wrapper swiper-wrapper"><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nxsttv.com/nmw/wp-content/uploads/sites/107/2024/03/AP24040178800807.jpg></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nxsttv.com/nmw/wp-content/uploads/sites/107/2024/03/AP24040178830407.jpg></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nxsttv.com/nmw/wp-content/uploads/sites/107/2024/03/AP24040178831401.jpg></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nxsttv.com/nmw/wp-content/uploads/sites/107/2024/03/AP24040509086939.jpg></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nxsttv.com/nmw/wp-content/uploads/sites/107/2024/03/AP24042737958664.jpg></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nxsttv.com/nmw/wp-content/uploads/sites/107/2024/03/AP24047046592776.jpg></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nxsttv.com/nmw/wp-content/uploads/sites/107/2024/03/AP24047155833635.jpg></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nxsttv.com/nmw/wp-content/uploads/sites/107/2024/03/AP24063668367205.jpg></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nxsttv.com/nmw/wp-content/uploads/sites/107/2024/03/AP24031739049691.jpg></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nxsttv.com/nmw/wp-content/uploads/sites/107/2024/03/AP24044714955291.jpg></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nxsttv.com/nmw/wp-content/uploads/sites/107/2024/03/AP24047165264822.jpg></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nxsttv.com/nmw/wp-content/uploads/sites/107/2024/03/AP24047177099422.jpg></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nxsttv.com/nmw/wp-content/uploads/sites/107/2024/03/AP24060144652571.jpg></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nxsttv.com/nmw/wp-content/uploads/sites/107/2024/03/AP24060559272428.jpg></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nxsttv.com/nmw/wp-content/uploads/sites/107/2024/03/AP24060596489039.jpg></li></ul><p>On Thursday, Clark announced she would&nbsp;<a href=#>enter the 2024 WNBA draft</a>&nbsp;and skip the fifth year of eligibility available to athletes who competed during the COVID-19 pandemic. She is projected to be the No. 1 overall pick by the Indiana Fever, and the&nbsp;<a href=#>WNBA already is seeing a rise in ticket sales.</a></p><p>Logitix, which researches prices on ticket resale platforms, reported an average sale price of $598 for a ticket to this game purchased since Feb. 1.</p><p>“Listen, this is the greatest ticket on the planet right now,” Woodard said in an interview with ESPN before the game. “Hey, I’m going to enjoy this right now.”</p><p>Clark is all but assured of one or two more appearances at the arena in Iowa City after Sunday.&nbsp;<a href=#>Iowa is projected to be a No. 2 seed</a>&nbsp;for the NCAA Tournament, meaning it would be at home for the first two rounds.</p><p><a href=#>Pearl Moore of Francis Marion</a>&nbsp;owns the overall women’s record with 4,061 points from 1975-79 at the small-college level in the AIAW. Moore had 177 points at Anderson Junior College before enrolling at Francis Marion.</p><p>Clark was 393 behind Moore as of halftime Sunday, and she has only three to 10 more games left in an Iowa uniform depending on how far the Hawkeyes advance in the Big Ten and NCAA tournaments.</p><p>The fall of Maravich’s record will be&nbsp;<a href=#>subject to scrutiny</a>.</p><p>Maravich’s all-time scoring mark is one of the more remarkable in sports history. There was no shot clock or 3-point line in his era. The 3-point line was adopted in 1986.</p><p>Maravich averaged 44.2 points per game. He scored more than 60 in a game four times, topping out at 69 against Alabama on Feb. 7, 1970.</p><p>Clark averages 28.3 points for her career and was playing in her 130th game Sunday. Her career-best output was 49 points against Michigan on Feb. 15, when she passed Kelsey Plum as the NCAA women’s Division I career scoring leader.</p><p>Clark has 54 games with at least 30 points, the most of any player in men’s or women’s college basketball over the last 25 years. She has six triple-doubles this season and 17 in her career.</p><p>“What Caitlin’s done has been amazing. She’s a fantastic player, great for the women’s game and basketball in general,” Maravich’s eldest son, Jaeson told The Associated Press last week.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46nmK2hn6OurXnNnq6sZ5OWtrW4yKdknKSRp7huucCknKxlYmKzs7HEZquhqp%2BswG6u0Z6YpKtdpbK1sYymmKuZpp6wqb%2BMp5qamV2osLC%2ByKeeZqqVmLyzsI4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
