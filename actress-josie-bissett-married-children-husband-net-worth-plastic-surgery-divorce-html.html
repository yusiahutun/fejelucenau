That’s just how I grew up, with a really big family. So I was super bummed and devastated.&nbsp;I got pregnant the first time we tried and [after the miscarriage] I could not get pregnant for two years.&nbsp;You don’t know what you don’t know. If you haven’t been through a miscarriage, you don’t know. You don’t know what death feels like until it happens. I get that feeling of what she (my character Sonia) went through. I tapped into that feeling of loss and hopelessness and wanting to become a mother.”</p><p style=text-align:justify>However, she currently is a mother of two, yet finding time for beloved children while living her dream is still a tough job for the actress who says,</p><p style=text-align:justify>“It’s really hard. I think all moms must feel it, but especially moms who have this drive to succeed. After I had Mason, that’s when I started writing books. I could not&nbsp;not&nbsp;create. I found a different way to create. I didn’t want to be on set and miss raising my child, but I also couldn’t just raise him. I had to fulfill that creative side of me. If I didn’t, I don’t know what I’d do with myself.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p style=text-align:justify>Though, hard times,&nbsp;Josie fulfilled her duties as a loving mom.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-655></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmauys63MqaypZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZpqbpKeytL%2BMo6asoZVir6q%2F0p6rrWWdlr%2BztcSdZJygmaGxs7HNZp%2Buq5KWu6V5zZ6rZq%2Bfp8Gpec%2BlmKysmZh6tMHRoJyrsV2Ztre70ZycZ6Ckork%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
