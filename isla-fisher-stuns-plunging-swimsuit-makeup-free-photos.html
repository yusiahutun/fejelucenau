The 47-year-old was all smiles as she posed for one photo in front of a swimming pool alongside Father Christmas, wrapping her arms around his waist while displaying her long legs in her festive, plunging one-piece. 
With the sun shining down on her, the 'Confessions of a Shopaholic' actress looked radiant as she beamed for the camera, accessorizing her bathing suit with a pair of black sunglasses and a green and white baseball cap to protect her auburn hair."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

"I'm definitely not a morning person. I struggle to be happy before 11 am, even though my alarm goes off at 7 am," she told <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The Sun</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=eynXDwfQ6tg data-wc=28>"I'll take a quick shower and usually dress in workout wear in an attempt to inspire myself to exercise at some point during the day, which rarely happens."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1bd161e63deb-isla-fisher-green-swimsuit.jpg><p id=eqqV5W7FWU data-wc=29>When she does exercise, the actress prefers swimming with her children, Olive, 15, Elula, 12, and Montgomery, eight, and hiking near her home in Perth in her native Australia.</p><p id=eFNIWvZpTXa data-wc=17>She also practices yoga as she loves the "mind-body experience" she gets, especially after a busy day.&nbsp;</p><p id=eLQDrP4AYw data-wc=50>When it comes to her diet, Isla once confessed that she "eats like a seagull" but is mindful about what she puts into her body. "Usually, I'll grab whatever the other people in my house don't want, which is anything from spare carrots to nuts and leftover pasta," she explained.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3f75250aeaf8-isla-fisher-orange-swimsuit.jpg><p id=eds8KWwmQ3 data-wc=40>"I have a giant bag of cashew nuts at all times in case I need a quick snack, too. I never bother cooking just for myself – I'll send for takeout or have a meeting at a restaurant for lunch."&nbsp;</p><p id=eRId2pAjT-i data-wc=33>Speaking about her daily diet, Isla said: "Breakfast is a flurry of making porridge and Rice Krispies. Before I head out the door, I'll make myself a latte with our fancy coffee machine.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/37e4947702d1-isla-fisher-hiking.jpg><p id=eEgr2Su8Po data-wc=45>"When I'm working on a book, I need frequent breaks to keep my spirits up, and I'll tuck into a pastry whenever I run out of inspiration. It means I can barely fit into my jeans by the time I've completed the book!" she joked.&nbsp;</p><p id=e28OKXi4K6E data-wc=38>For dinner, Isla loves to dine on her husband, <a class=hm-link href=#>Sacha Baron Cohen</a>'s "amazing tomato sauce". "He crams it full of secret veggies and it's honestly better than any marinara I've ever tasted – even from Italy!" she raved.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/bd48fd56e479-isla-fisher-sacha-baron-cohen.jpg><p id=eHwLDPH1qZh data-wc=34>"If I'm cooking dinner then I like to make chicken soup, grilled fish, or something child-friendly like schnitzel.
