This is war. But like I said‚Ä¶ We all know who wins in the end <img role=img draggable=false alt=üôèüèª src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/svg/1f64f-1f3fb.svg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>&nbsp;<img role=img draggable=false alt=‚úùÔ∏è src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/svg/271d.svg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>‚Äù The younger daughter wrote on her IG.</p><p>In another message, Gigi claimed that the enemy which she referred to as the world doesn‚Äôt wanna see good people win.
