I have trust issues, things like that. I saw some stuff in myself that I just didn’t dig. It’s like when I brought a girl home to my mom and it looked as if my mom really didn’t like this girl. And she told me, ‘I like her just fine. I just don’t like you around her.’ That’s how I feel in this situation. There were some things about myself that I didn’t like. People got to take inventory from time to time. That’s what this [coming to South Africa] is for.”</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/dave-chappelle-1.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-623014388.jpg><p>He’s also made film appearances in Robin Hood: Men in Tights , The Nutty Professor, <a href=# id=auto-tag_dave-chappelle data-tag=dave-chappelle>Dave Chappelle</a>‘s Block Party, Chi-Raq, and A Star Is Born. In 2016,&nbsp;he signed a $20-million-per-release comedy-special deal with&nbsp;Netflix. His 2021 comedy special The Closer included transphobic comments and jokes that sparked controversy to the LGBTQ+ community and several Netflix walkouts organized by the Netflix trans&nbsp;employee resource group. Chappelle<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>&nbsp;went on his&nbsp;Midnight Miracle&nbsp;podcast</a>&nbsp;to react to the backlash he faced. “The trans [people] and their surrogates, always say that my jokes are somehow gonna be the root cause of some impending violence that they feel like is inevitable for my jokes,” Chappelle said. “But I gotta tell you, as abrasive as they were, the way they were protesting, throwing eggs at people, throwing barricades, cussing and screaming, [none of my fans] beat ‘em up.”</p><p>Apart from his controversies, Chappelle seems to keep his<a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/celebrity-news/1264183/dave-chappelle-attacked/> personal life</a> very private. Here’s what we know of Dave Chappelle’s wife.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=who-is-dave-chappelle-s-wife>Who is Dave Chappelle’s wife?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/dave-chappelle-wife-1.jpg><p>Dave Chappelle’s wife is Elaine Mendoza Erfe. The couple married in 2001 and have three kids together, sons Sulayman and Ibrahim, and daughter Sanaa.</p><p>Elaine is a Filipino-American who grew up in Brooklyn, New York. Before they raised a family together, Elaine was set to have a career in the culinary arts. &nbsp;“She doesn’t work as a professional chef, [but the kids] regularly eat like kings at home, thanks to her excellent culinary skills,” he said in a past&nbsp;interview, per&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Netline</a>.</p><p>The two met in her hometown and she continues to support him through his career. “She was with me when I was poor,” he recalled on <a href=# data-type=link data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a2Fq9I1dak" rel=nofollow>The Howard Stern Show.</a></p><p>Chappelle explained to Stern that his wife keeps him grounded around his notoreity. “My wife, if it gets real bad, she’ll let me know, like, ‘Oh, you should look into this.’ But for the most part, I try not to pay attention to it because you don’t want to be careful as a comedian. I try to keep my business small enough so it can still be authentic enough.”</p><p>Around the same time that Chappelle walked out of his $50 million Comedy Central deal with Chappelle’s Show, he said that his wife wasn’t so pleased with the decision. In 2006, he told<a rel=nofollow href=# data-type=link data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8-J5vxbpGI">&nbsp;Conan O’Brien</a>, “My wife’s still a little salty… She’s not mad at me, but don’t think you’re going to walk away from $50 million and your wife’s just gonna be cool with it.”</p><p>The two moved to Yellow Springs, Ohio in 2006. &nbsp;“It’s almost like a&nbsp;nature&nbsp;reserve where they’ll let me run free,” he said of his residence. Though as the years gone by, coming home to his children is pretty different. “I see my age in my children,” Dave said in a special. “When my kids were little and the tour bus would pull up to the house, [they’d] spill out. ‘Dad is home, hooray!’ Then as the years went on, they’d get less interested. ‘Hey everybody, look: It’s Mr. Promises back from the road.'”</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
