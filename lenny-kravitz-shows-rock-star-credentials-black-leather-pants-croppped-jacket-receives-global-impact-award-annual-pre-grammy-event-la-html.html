received&nbsp;he Global Impact Award at the Recording Academy Honors presented by the Black Music Collective at the Fairmont Century Plaza on Thursday in Los Angeles</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Kravitz, 59, made his grand arrival in an all-black ensemble consisting of fitted shiny leather pants and a cropped leather jacket over a white cropped shirt that he left unbuttoned to nearly his naval.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In an added touch, he matched the shirt with a white scarf that he had hanging around his neck all the way down past his waistline.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The New York City native also wore a pair of pointed black leather boots, and accessorized with shiny dark mirror sunglasses, studded belts, an assortment of rings, earrings and bracelets.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Rounding out every one of his looks in recent years, as well as back in his earlier days, were his long dreads that fell over his shoulders and down to about the middle of his back.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The fashion icon first grew out his locks into dreads back in the late 1980s, and kept them long and flowing until he decided to cut them off in 2000.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The&nbsp;singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist first gained recognition for his music when he was known as Romeo Blue, but by the time he dropped his debut studio album, Let Love Rule (1989) he had adopted his given name once again.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A combination of rock and funk with a 1960s retro vibe, initially critics were torn between him being a gifted new artist, while others thought he relied too much on his musical influence of the 60s-70s.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Then wife Lisa Bonet, who had been riding the success of The Cosby Show at the time, ended up directing the debut music video for the title track, Let Love Rule, which would also lean on the Flower Power look of yesteryear.</p><img

five singles including the title track,&nbsp;Build This Garden For Us, and Mr. Cab Driver</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Straight out of the gate, Kravitz presented his art as a virtual one-man show, writing and producing all the songs and playing nearly ever instrument that includes guitar, drums, bass, keyboards and vocals.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>While Let Love Rule reached number 61 on the Billboard 200 and&nbsp;number 56 on the UK Albums Chart, Kravitz had his sights set on expanding his music with added touches of R&B, reggae, hard rock and soul, to go along with his retro rock and funk style already in tact.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The follow up - Mama Said (1991) - would put any doubts of his songwriting prowess to rest while earning him&nbsp;full on rock star credentials by selling&nbsp;enough copies to be certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association Od America (RIAA), which was due in part to the power of the seven singles&nbsp;released, beginning with Always On The Run.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He further cemented his rock star status with the release of nine more studio albums, through the three decades until Raise Vibration (2018).&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The New York City native, who also grew up in Los Angeles, is now preparing to drop his&nbsp;twelfth studio album - Blue Electric Light - on March 15 by Roxie Records with distribution handled by BMG Rights Management.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In the lead up to the new record, the rocker released the first single, TK421,
