He started acting on big or small screens and had various projects in hand (later) to perform on the stage. If you have not heard about him, let’s tell you that he is a British Musician and an actor on the rise. He is a model, actor, star, and musician. Years back, when he had the premiere of the screening of his film Modern Life is Rubbish, where he played the lead role, he was battling with the breakup with his girlfriend.</p><p>It was probably Whitehouse’s first appearance in Japan, where he had the premiere of the film. The most astonishing thing was that there was no shortage of fans screaming in public to ask for his autograph. He appeared on the stage showing his handsome face, and the big surprise was that he had the performance on the two songs from the film.</p><h3>Early Life</h3><p>Josh Whitehouse was born on 27th February 1990 in London, England, UK. He was brought up in Chester, Cheshire, England, UK, by his loving and caring parents, John Whitehouse (father) and Penelope Whitehouse (mother). He shared his childhood with his only sibling, Abi Whitehouse.</p><h3>Josh Whitehouse Career</h3><p>Josh says that it was hard to pay off the industry with what he did in the past for the entertainment and his fans. He had the leading role in the British TV series Poldark, which became the clear stamp of approval. But, before he got approved for the film, he was shocked to learn that he would be filmed for the BBC channel. He thought, “I would be an actor now.” The thing that makes him connect with the films and acting is music. He says that whatever he does, he comes back and connects to music always.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=udf70da7355d3f574eee9f05994d6994d><span class=ctaText>Read Also:</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Alex Hassell Biography</span></a><p>“I feel like everything else is more of a career path, but regardless of what happens, I’m still going to want to make music. Always”. He had various music stage appearances with his band and performed, More Like Trees; solo work; and collaborations, including a 14-piece hip-hop band.</p><p>In May 2019, The Iron Throne, the sixth episode of season 8 and the final ever episode of Game of Thrones, was aired on HBO. And almost after eight years of that release, the Song of Fire and Ice was officially sung. The cast included Josh Whitehouse, who at that time got his own Wikipedia page and was highly appreciated by www.cnet.com.</p><h4>How did Josh Whitehouse get the first gig in the films?</h4><p>In his interview with bccjacumen.com, Josh said he never expected to become an actor. Instead, he was playing songs and music with his band and trying for modeling jobs, which he also got in return or after some hard work. That time, he had a face over by a director named Elaine Constantine. She approached him and said she had been working on a film for over 15 years. She asked, “do you know about Northern Soul Music?”</p><p>After that, the director invited Josh to learn some tactics and steps of the dance she wanted in her film. He had to attend dance classes and did the same for nearly two years. She would probably send him acting coaches and make him understand the magnitude of acting, the molding and shaping of the body and voices to fit into the character. Then, the director officially offered him the role in the last couple of weeks of those two years.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=ub7781e8989d5655ef85d40d06488824b><span class=ctaText>Read Also:</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Ceara Coveney Biography</span></a><p>The film was called Northern Soul, originally written and directed by Elaine Constantine, where Josh Whitehouse acted as the soul-music-loving DJ. Later, Josh returned to his music band, but he was given another role to stay with his perfection in the films. Now, it was the big step, and he got another role in the film Modern Life is Rubbish.</p><table><tbody><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Josh Whitehouse Biography</h3></th></tr><tr><td width=40%>Real Name</td><td width=60%>Josh Whitehouse</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Date</td><td>27 February 1990</td></tr><tr><td>Age (as of 2023)</td><td>33 Years</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Place</td><td>London, United Kingdom</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actor, Musician</td></tr><tr><td>College</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Qualification</td><td>Graduate</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Physical Statistics</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>in feet inches&nbsp;<strong>– 6’ 2” – </strong>in Centimeters <strong>– 186 cm</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>in Kilograms&nbsp;<strong>– 80 kg&nbsp; –&nbsp; </strong>in Pounds&nbsp;<strong>–&nbsp; 176 lbs</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Hair Color</td><td>Light Brown</td></tr><tr><td>Eye Color</td><td>Brown</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center colspan=2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthyspy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Josh-Whitehouse-2.jpg alt width=960 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Family</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Father</td><td>John</td></tr><tr><td>Mother</td><td>Penelope Sinclair Whitehouse</td></tr><tr><td>Sister</td><td>Abi Whitehouse</td></tr><tr><td>Brother</td><td>Jon Whitehouse, Matthew Whitehouse</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Relationship Status</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Marital Status</td><td>In Relation</td></tr><tr><td>Affair</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Who is his girlfriend?</td><td>Cindy Jourdin</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Personal Life</h3><p>Josh Whitehouse barely connects with anyone talking about his personal life.
