We wish we could be as free as Jason Kelce, who was seen at the Super Bowl having the time of his life. The 36-year-old was spotted spending time with his brother Travis Kelce and his girlfriend after the Kansas City Chiefs win on Sunday (February 11). The Chiefs were playing against the San Francisco 49ers and ended up winning 25-22, even though it didn’t look like it was going in their favor; up until halftime, the 49ers were in the lead with 10-3."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The moment was caught on camera and shared on Instagram. Then, in one of their podcast episodes, Travis teased him about it.</p><p>Travis said “Never once been on his <a href=#>Instagram</a>?” referring to their dad never having posted his son on his Instagram until he was shirtless in celebration.</p><p>“Listen kids, if you want to make your dad proud, take your shirt off, drink your beer and scream on the top of your lungs and apparently that’s what does it,” Jason responded.</p><p>Proud of his older sibling, Travis said: “That’s my boy!”</p><p>The post in question was captioned “Jason celebrating Trav’s score,” and had many people talking in the comments.</p><p>One person penned: “Jason is the ultimate hype man and a fantastic big brother!!!”</p><p>Another said: “Your sons are great guys, man!
