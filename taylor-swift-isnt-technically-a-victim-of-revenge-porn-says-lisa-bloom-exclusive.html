"Most of us would be shocked and sickened if someone posted a naked picture of someone intended to look like us was put out in the world to millions of followers."</p><p>Bloom saluted Swift for standing up for herself and for saying no to revenge porn.

A secretly recorded video subsequently posted by Kanye's wife Kim Kardashian seemed to contradict this narrative, as it showed the two musicians discussing the same and Kanye clearly asking for her blessing.</p><p>Swift later claimed her point of contention was being referred to as a "bitch" in the song; nevertheless the episode earned her the snake reputation, which she in turned owned and used it for the theme of her last album and tour.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>White feminists are so fragile when you dismantle their feminism.
