"Especially as you keep getting triggered by more hurtful words revealed about you from the person who wounded you deeply as a child."</p><p>She said that despite wanting to be able to move on and get past these feelings, "healing is not linear."

"It's sad to see someone not change after all these years."</p><p>"Nothing that she said in her book about me actually happened. I wish I could go back in time and tell my 12 year old self that you are actually extremely lucky to not have a friend like her," she added. "You are way better off without her.

She has not yet publicly responded to any of Nikolas' comments, nor has she liked the latest one.
