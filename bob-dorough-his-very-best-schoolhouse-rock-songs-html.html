For anyone who grew up learning grammar and multiplication tables by listening to songs like “Conjunction Junction” or “Three Is a Magic Number,” it’s like a light in our childhood playrooms has gone out.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjge3y6uf001l3i5z2v39vajy@published data-word-count=127>Generations of kids have been introduced to the tracks Dorough wrote or sang, including all 11 of the songs on Multiplication Rock (which kick-started the Schoolhouse Rock phenomenon in 1973), as well as several favorites that were part of the collections that focused on grammar, American history, science and, later, money and ecoconsciousness. But for people who grew up in the 1970s and ’80s, when the original Schoolhouse Rock shorts were shown during Saturday morning cartoon commercial breaks, Dorough’s death has particular poignancy. Listening to these songs today is a reminder of what a talent he was: Yes, all these tunes about pronouns and women’s suffrage were designed to educate children, but they succeeded because they were really good, really catchy, and smartly crafted pieces of music.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjge3y8fd003i3i5zzyin9j6v@published data-word-count=61>As a tribute to Dorough, here’s a ranking of all 33 of the Schoolhouse Rock songs to which he contributed, either as a composer, performer, or both. It’s a testament to his genius that if you asked me to rank these again tomorrow, I’d probably put them in a slightly different order. They’re all, to borrow a Dorough lyric, magic numbers.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjge3y70a001m3i5zwwtoi6ng@published data-word-count=41>(Please note that this list only includes Dorough’s works, which is why you won’t find “I’m Just a Bill” — written by Dave Frishberg and performed by Jack Sheldon — and some other Schoolhouse Rock classics like “Interplanet Janet” and “Interjection.”)</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjge3y749001o3i5z6rex7v1p@published data-word-count=8><strong>33. “The Three Rs” (2009; music by Dorough)</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjge3y74s001p3i5zsdc4ol81@published data-word-count=114>This is, without question, the worst song on this list, and it’s through no fault of Dorough’s. When Disney issued the Schoolhouse Rock: Earth DVD in 2009, apparently someone thought it would be a good idea to teach kids about recycling by recycling the music from Dorough’s masterpiece “Three Is a Magic Number,” getting Jack Johnson to write some new, environmentally conscious lyrics, then recruiting Mitchel Musso from Hannah Montana to perform it in “hip” Disney fashion. I almost didn’t include this one since Dorough only has a credit on it because they ripped off his melody. But then I changed my mind because watching this video made me think of another R-word: ridiculous.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjge3y75b001q3i5zrdf6u7s9@published data-word-count=13><strong>32. “Report From the North Pole” (2009; music by Dorough, who also co-performs)</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjge3y75o001r3i5zjkrwgcnz@published data-word-count=60>The bottom half of this list is inevitably dominated by the newer Schoolhouse Rock songs, which, as a general rule, don’t hold up quite as well as the originals.

(“We could never reach a star without you, Zero, my hero, how wonderful you are.”)&nbsp;Think about it in the second context and you might just tear up while you listen. Not that I did that earlier today or anything.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjge3y8c4003c3i5zjtcmmqaf@published data-word-count=14><strong>3. “Lolly, Lolly, Lolly Get Your Adverbs Here” (1974; written and performed by Dorough)</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjge3y8ci003d3i5zzsdipylr@published data-word-count=22>Like some of the best Schoolhouse Rock songs, this one uses acceleration and speed to its advantage.

It’s an all-timer and Dorough’s greatest hit.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjge3y8e3003g3i5z8s9nrxtc@published data-word-count=12><strong>1. “Three Is a Magic Number” (1973; written and performed by Dorough)</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjge3y8ex003h3i5zqcwvobki@published data-word-count=75>As great as “Conjunction Junction” is, “Three Is a Magic Number” is downright beautiful. It’s not just about the fact that three times seven is 21, although it’s nice to have that confirmed in song form. It’s a life-affirming prayer of a tune, something you croon softly to your firstborn child: “A man and a woman had a little baby / Yes, they did / They had three in the family/And that’s a magic number.”</p><span class=ambrose-short-hed>The Very Best Schoolhouse Rock Songs by Bob Dorough</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlocWdgaXyju8Fmm6iqn6q0qXnHoqpmrpWnxm6uxKyrZquTnbywuMeorKydXae8pLeMrKann6NjtbW5yw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
