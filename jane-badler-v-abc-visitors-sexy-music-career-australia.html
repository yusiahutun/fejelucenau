(She also is a singer; visit <a href=#>JaneBadler.com</a>, and check out her CD art above!)<strong></strong></p><p>You're quite a globe-trotter. Where do you live now?<br><b><br></b>I lived in [Australia] for 20 years. I filmed ["V"] in Vancouver so I moved there for four months for filming. I sortof bowed out for awhile. I moved to Australia to do [the TV series] "Mission Impossible" and met an Australian man [<strong>Stephen Haines</strong>] soI stayed and raised a family. While there I was a stageactress and cabaret singer, although I did do a lot of film and television.</p><p><strong>Do you want to move back to the U.S.?</strong></p><p>I think New Yorkis my town and I absolutely am thinking about it as we speak. It is somethingthat is being talked about to my family about possibly moving there next year.It's a definite possibility. After twenty years, I've been brought back into American television again soit's all very exciting.<br><b><br>How does it feelworking on the new "V"?</b><br></p><p>It feels like a different show yet it doesn't. That'sthe weird thing about it. It's not the old "V," but it still has elements of theold "V." And certainly my character is not the old Diana and yet there are elements of the old Diana. Now I am more of a supporting character to [actress]<strong>Morena [Baccarin]</strong> who plays the character that I once was. I'm her mother. But I don'tthink the character is any less powerful just because it moved to somethingdifferent</p><p><b>Why are the aliens (aka "Visitors")sexier than the humans?</b></p><p>Obviously people think they are sexier. I kind of thinkthey are too, but I think we're sexier because of what we get to do. We get tohave fangs and have blood on our face and there is kind of a morbid sexiness toall that. We get to say great lines and be evil and have power, be sexyand wear tight clothes. So it all adds to the sexy element doesn't it?</p><p><b>What other projects are youworking on?</b></p><p>I'm really busy right now. I've been very lucky to have justcome back from Europe where I have been promoting "V" andalso have signed with music management. I'm a singer and a recording artist soI'm planning to tour Europe with my music and also I'm about to do a tour inAustralia with my band, and I'm performing here and so I'm quite busy with allof that.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2JlfnJ7j2tma2tfn66vsYybmJ2klad6t3nAm5pmrpmotrW70axkrJ2ornquwdKimmabkaeypr6MmqysrKKWuaqtjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
