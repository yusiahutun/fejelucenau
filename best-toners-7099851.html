In the past, toners were harsh, powerful solutions that made your skin overly dry and stripped it of its natural oils.

Made with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>hypochlorous acid</a>, this natural ingredient works to reduce the appearance of redness on the spot, successfully soothes and nourishes skin, and provides much-needed hydration. Additionally, this face toner helps to clear skin over time by cleaning out pores from the inside out. As for the best part? Thanks to the innovative blend of ingredients in its formula, the product creates an anti-inflammatory and antibacterial shield for the skin, blocking harmful germs, gunk, and bacteria from building up. (Read: Fewer breakouts!)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">According to our tester, this toner goes above and beyond to effectively clean skin. “It cleanses my skin well and removes excess grime that my face wash alone can’t pick up,” she says. Aside from just purifying complexions, this product also adds supple moisture. “My skin feels more hydrated, refreshed, and rejuvenated, and it gives my skin a glowy boost without feeling heavy or sticky,” our tester adds.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For best results, use this toner both in the morning and evening. You can spritz it directly on your face or wet a cotton round (though it takes four to six sprays to adequately saturate a round). Additionally, if you have red blemishes, sunburns, rashes, or eczema, bring this toner on the go and spritz it when needed for an instant refresh.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Active Ingredients: </strong>Hypochlorous acid, butylated hydroxyanisole |<strong> Key Benefits: </strong>Soothes, hydrates, cleanses<strong> </strong>|<strong> Skin Type: </strong>Dry, sensitive, acne-prone |<strong> Size: </strong>4 oz.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-anti-aging-renee-rouleau-elderberry-soothing-toner></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Anti-Aging</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Renee Rouleau Elderberry Soothing Toner</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Renee Rouleau Elderberry Soothing Toner" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/KrOF6E0brp32ryxK1BWc9LiH54U=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/renee-rouleau-elderberry-soothing-toner-85730486d7f142dcb31fc9701d4492d0.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Renee Rouleau</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Plump, bouncy skin is in close reach when you use this Renée Rouleau facial toner. Made with elderberry fruit extract (which provides skin with a hearty dose of antioxidants), sodium PCA (a water-binding agent that works to attract and retain moisture), and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Biosaccharide Gum-1</a> (a soothing and hydrating sugar molecule that stores water between the cells), this product quickly and effectively hydrates the skin, while also minimizing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. And while this toner works wonders to hydrate skin, it also regulates oil production thanks to ylang ylang flower oil (the ingredient also gives the product a light floral scent).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Along with plumping the skin and balancing oil production, this face toner can also address hyperpigmentation, lessening the appearance of age spots and acne scars. “I love that this has anti-aging antioxidants that address so many concerns,” our tester raves. “It's never too early to start preventive care!”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Active Ingredients: </strong>Elderberry fruit extract, ylang ylang flower oil, citric acid |<strong> Key Benefits: </strong>Hydrates, soothes, calms, refreshes |<strong> Skin Type: </strong>Normal, dry, combination |<strong> Size: </strong>6 oz.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-sk-ii-facial-treatment-clear-lotion-toner></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>SK-II Clear Lotion Skin Toner</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="SK-II Facial Treatment Clear Lotion Toner" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/jSjhzorgndFhs3x6mRvLdIVufi0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/SK-II-Facial-Treatment-Clear-Lotion-Toner-71e25d6b84c04a768ffae3bcd56bfbb0.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Concentrated with a mix of three powerful exfoliating acids (citric, salicylic, and lactic), this toner deeply cleanses and hydrates skin, providing long-lasting benefits. Citric acid works to exfoliate your complexion, sloughing away dead skin cells from the surface and effectively cleaning gunk from deep within pores. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Salicylic acid</a> works in tandem with citric acid, removing excess sebum and ultimately reducing oiliness. Finally, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>lactic acid</a> steps in to fade dark spots, improve skin tone and texture, and reduce the appearance of superficial wrinkles.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This toner is also made with Pitera, SK-II’s signature liquid, which is derived from the process of rice fermentation and packed with vitamins, minerals, and amino acids to help support the skin’s cell turnover process. The ingredient also helps to hydrate and nourish, making this face toner great for anyone who needs a boost of hydration.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“This is such a soothing and lightweight formula that preps the skin nicely for other serums and creams,” our tester notes. “It helps with my dull, uneven skin texture and feels hydrating!” Keep in mind, though, that the toner does have a strong herbal scent, so you may want to avoid it if you’re sensitive to fragrance.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Active Ingredients: </strong>Citric acid, salicylic acid, lactic acid<strong> </strong>|<strong> Key Benefits: </strong>Hydrates, boosts radiance, minimizes pores<strong> </strong>|<strong> Skin Type: </strong>Normal, oily, dry, combination<strong> </strong>|<strong> Size: </strong>5.4 oz.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-neutrogena-alcohol-free-facial-toner></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Neutrogena Alcohol-Free Toner</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Neutrogena Alcohol-Free Facial Toner" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/X9S6TIZA-2_XL8ajybvYbOIey2o=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Neutrogena-Alcohol-Free-Facial-Toner-3cb8633714824d499972f26a23faac14.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re looking for an affordable, everyday toner, you can’t go wrong with this Neutrogena favorite. What really makes this toner stand out is its ability to refresh skin both instantly and gradually, so you’ll be able to notice long-lasting benefits after each use. The hypoallergenic and non-comedogenic formula gently cleanses skin by removing impurities from deep within pores; plus, it mildly hydrates skin, thanks to the addition of panthenol in the ingredient list. (Panthenol, also known as vitamin B5, helps to decrease transepidermal water loss, meaning the skin won’t dry out as easily.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to making skin feel good, this toner also makes skin look good. “My face looks very clear after using this product,” our tester reports, adding, “I recommend this product to everyone. It makes my face feel clean and refreshed.” Oh, and did we mention it’s under 10 bucks? Yeah, that, too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Active Ingredients: </strong>Butylene glycol, panthenol |<strong> Key Benefits: </strong>Cleanses, hydrates, refreshes |<strong> Skin Type: </strong>Normal, oily, combination |<strong> Size: </strong>8.5 oz.<strong></strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-drugstore-thayers-alcohol-free-rose-petal-witch-hazel-facial-toner></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Drugstore</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Thayers Witch Hazel Facial Toner</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Thayers Alcohol-Free Rose Petal Witch Hazel Facial Toner" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/gn6G8cs8kdAhznpBXv9O7LVqQy0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Thayers-Alcohol-Free-Rose-Petal-Witch-Hazel-Facial-Toner-2ff98220a8d04decb4326ef955f98d02.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Whether you’re a big beauty buff or not, there’s a good chance you've seen a bottle of Thayers facial toner at some point in your life. This fan-favorite brand has been around for ages (literally since 1847), and that’s because its offerings are reliable, effective, and affordable.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One of the Thayers’ bestselling products is its notable rose petal and witch hazel facial toner. Made with a blend of three powerhouse ingredients (rose water, aloe vera, and witch hazel), the formula makes skin glow. Individually, rose water gently cleans out pores, removing impurities and helping clear skin over time; aloe vera provides supple hydration to the skin, making complexions smoother, dewier, and more nourished; and finally, Thayers’ claim-to-fame ingredient — organic, non-distilled witch hazel — has antibacterial benefits, targets blemishes, and keeps acne from spreading. Overall, the classic toner cleanses, hydrates, repairs, and replenishes skin from the inside out.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While the bottle is part of what makes this product so iconic, it’s also a bit bulky which can make dispensing the toner a bit cumbersome — this isn’t a big deal, but something to keep in mind if you have minimal vanity space.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Active Ingredients: </strong>Rose water, aloe vera, witch hazel |<strong> Key Benefits: </strong>Cleanses, hydrates, evens out skin tone |<strong> Skin Type: </strong>Normal, oily, combination, acne-prone |<strong> Size:</strong> 12 oz.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-hydrating-fresh-rose--hyaluronic-acid-deep-hydration-toner></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Hydrating</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Fresh Rose Deep Hydration Toner</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Fresh Rose &amp;amp; Hyaluronic Acid Deep Hydration Toner" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/lZPD_-GG75GPIITCPHQN3kFAztw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/fresh-1946c062b86e478a8bf29df87d42f706.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If your skin is dry, flaky, or in need of hydration, we have just the thing for you.

The addition of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>green tea</a> makes this product ideal for anyone who is looking to address signs of redness because it works overtime to calm the skin, as well as clean out clogged pores that can lead to acne.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our tester, who has sensitive skin and struggles with redness and hormonal acne, gave this toner rave reviews. “My skin was irritated prior to application because of hormones, but afterward, the redness and irritation went down completely,” she notes. “This product single-handedly reduced the redness from my hormonal acne in about three minutes.” Our tester also mentions that it takes some extra work to administer the product onto a cotton round since the dispenser is so small, but this feature ensures that it doesn’t splash everywhere.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Active Ingredients: </strong>Hyaluronic acid, green tea, panthenol<strong> </strong>|<strong> Key Benefits: </strong>Soothes, hydrates, refreshes<strong> </strong>|<strong> Skin Type: </strong>Normal, dry, oily, combination |<strong> Size:</strong> 5.4 oz.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-large-pores-ren-clean-skincare-ready-steady-glow-daily-aha-tonic></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Large Pores</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>REN Clean Skincare Ready Steady Glow Tonic</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="REN Clean Skincare Ready Steady Glow Daily AHA Tonic" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/4pqmhPQno_RAUl5fa66ZYLwuvj0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/REN-Clean-Skincare-Ready-Steady-Glow-Daily-AHA-Tonic-411f18c6216f47ae8796008eed6f1a01.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=2><p>This all-in-one toner brightens, exfoliates, hydrates, and tightens skin.</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Minimizing the appearance of large pores is no easy feat, but Ren Clean Skincare Ready Steady Glow tonic is here to help. This vegan face toner is made with a combination of ingredients that work hand-in-hand to target blemishes and clean out pores. Thanks to the inclusion of salicin (a BHA) from willow bark extract, this product is able to draw out impurities from within. Plus, lactic acid (an AHA), exfoliates skin and removes dead skin cells from the surface. To top it all off, this toner is also formulated with azelaic acid precursors (which are derived from grains) to visibly boost radiance and even out complexions.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“My pores opened up and looked smaller after the toner absorbed into my skin,” says our tester. Plus, she also notes that her skin looked clearer and more refreshed. While we recommend this toner to people who want to shrink their pores, it’s important to note that this does sting a bit after the initial application. “The sensation subsided after a few seconds and didn't cause any redness or major irritation afterward,” our tester notes. For the best results, use this toner once a day to minimize the risk of irritation.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Active Ingredients:</strong> Lactic acid, salicin |<strong> Key Benefits: </strong>Exfoliates, brightens, tightens<strong> </strong>|<strong> Skin Type: </strong>Normal, dry, oily, combination |<strong> Size: </strong>8.5 oz.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-dry-skin-laneige-cream-skin-toner--moisturizer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Dry Skin</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>LANEIGE Cream Skin Toner & Moisturizer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="LANEIGE Cream Skin Toner &amp;amp; Moisturizer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ALKdB8Q-i1pOSJsO_LoKUyRzKko=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Laneige-Cream-Skin-Toner--Moisturizer-ff7c6879b00b4472a1cebb7ff579d110.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If dry, flaky skin is something you struggle with, you may not think you need a toner, but this two-in-one toner-moisturizer from Laneige will change your mind. First and foremost, it’s a face toner that’s formulated to smooth and prep skin, but it also doubles as a moisturizer, which means after you apply it, you’re done with your skincare routine (no extra lotion needed!).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This duality is in part thanks to the white leaf tea water in the formula: The ingredient has a high concentration of amino acids that work to strengthen the skin barrier, while also locking in moisture. Plus, aside from just hydrating skin, it also brightens your complexion. “I would say my skin is rarely ever clear, but after using this I feel like I'm glowing from the inside out,” our tester says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">However, we will note that because this product is more hydrating than most toners, it’s not ideal for people with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>acne-prone skin</a>. The milky formula was made to nourish dry, flaky skin, which means it’s a bit heavy and can sometimes clog pores.

Made with salicylic acid, moringa seed extract, moringa water, papaya enzymes, and chlorella, this toner gets right down to business. To kick things off, the salicylic acid gently exfoliates and deeply cleans out pores,&nbsp;drawing out dirt and grime while also <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>controlling excess oil production</a>. On top of that, the moringa seed extract and moringa water work together to cleanse pores, removing impurities and minimizing shine.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Papaya enzymes also exfoliate, removing dead skin cells and clarifying complexions. Last but not least, chlorella — which is rich in antioxidants — nourishes and soothes the skin, so your face won’t be red or irritated after use. “It feels like this toner tightened my forehead area a bit,” our tester says. “My cheeks feel smoother, too.” As for the best part: This toner is made without parabens, mineral oil, and fragrances, and it’s cruelty-free. While you may be excited to experience the product for yourself, be sure to dispense it onto a cotton round carefully, because a lot can come out at once.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Active Ingredients: </strong>Salicylic acid, papaya enzymes, chlorella |<strong> Key Benefits: </strong>Exfoliates, cleanses, controls oil production<strong> </strong>|<strong> Skin Type: </strong>Combination, oily<strong> </strong>|<strong> Size: </strong>4 oz.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-hyperpigmentation-freck-beauty-cactus-water-cleansing-lactic-acid-toner></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best For Hyperpigmentation</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Freck Beauty Cactus Water Lactic Acid Toner</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Freck Beauty Cactus Water Cleansing Lactic Acid Toner" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/wnGqJR-g9wZxpF7rIxu_CrI0S04=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/freck-cactus-water-cleansing-lactic-acid-toner-e591d5febe73413582e23c3146bd2ae5.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Freck Beauty</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-75 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This Freck Beauty face toner may not look like much in a bottle (our tester initially thought it was a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>micellar water</a>), but it will quickly give your face a pristine glow. Made with cleansing cactus water and lactic acid, a little bit of this exfoliating toner goes a long way to rid the skin of dead cells and discoloration.

We love that it locks in moisture, leaving complexions plump, full, and dewy. On top of that, it also works to lighten dark spots caused by acne scars and hyperpigmentation, which ultimately makes skin more luminous and radiant than before.

On top of that, the face toner also brightens skin and clears complexions thanks to a handful of fruit extracts (including apple, watermelon, and cherry) that target dark spots and reduce redness.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-107 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Aside from the glowing ingredient list, we love this product for its unique texture. “The consistency is milky, which gives my cheeks a subtle glow and helps calm irritation,” our tester notes. However, because this toner is thicker than most, it might take longer for it to absorb into the skin. Just be sure to let it dry before applying serum or moisturizer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-108 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Active Ingredients: </strong>Tamarind, hyaluronic acid, panthenol |<strong> Key Benefits: </strong>Brightens, hydrates<strong> </strong>|<strong> Skin Type: </strong>Normal, dry, oily, combination |<strong> Size: </strong>5 oz.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-witch-hazel-murad-clarifying-toner></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Witch Hazel</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Murad Clarifying Toner</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Murad Clarifying Toner" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/HWIkGvVFRnUTR9Mb8hYU4w1-6Ik=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Murad-Clarifying-Toner-67891dd21e444bdaaf57272351339ef6.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-112 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you want a toner that will unclog pores, lighten hyperpigmentation, tighten skin, and control oil production, we have just what you’re looking for. This bestselling Murad toner does the trick, working quickly to clean, cleanse, and refresh the face. It’s made with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>witch hazel</a>, which helps to taper down oil, making complexions less greasy and shiny. Plus, it incorporates algae extract into the formula to unclog pores and keep oil from building up. On top of that, grape seed extract and vitamin E team up to protect the skin from free radical damage throughout the day.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-113 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“My skin looks really nice after using the toner,” our tester mentions. “It’s glowing, smooth, [and] glossy.

After reviewing the ratings, we rounded up the 24 most popular products and put them to the test. Seventeen testers analyzed the toners on a scale of 1 to 5 for four important categories: Feel, absorption, hydration, and how much their skin changed after using the toner over a period of time. Once the testers provided their feedback, we were able to narrow down the 18 best facial toners of 2024.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Jessica Juliao</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Skin Type</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When looking for a toner (or any skincare product for that matter), it’s important to find a product that caters to your specific skin type. “The right toner may differ from person to person depending on the skin type,” explains Dr. Dendy Engelman, board-certified cosmetic dermatologist. “If you have oily or acne-prone skin, you may want to look for a toner that contains both gentle exfoliants and soothing ingredients to balance the skin and prevent breakouts without over-drying.” (We recommend <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Farmacy Deep Sweep Pore Cleaning Toner</a>)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“If you have dry or sensitive skin, you should look for gentle toners that have a calming, hydrating effect on skin.

So, if you’re a skin minimalist, you can skip this step if you have other products that cater to your skin’s needs. However, if you really want to address certain skincare issues quickly and effectively, toner can definitely speed that process up.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>When should I use toner?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Face toner is best used after cleansing your skin, and before using serums or lotions in your routine,” says Dr. Portela. “Most toners are safe to use daily, and those that contain hydrating ingredients can even be used twice daily if you desire.” (If your skin needs a boost of hydration, we suggest bringing the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Tower28 SOS Daily Rescue Facial Spray</a> with you on the go, since you can easily spritz it on your face when needed.)</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Can I use toner every day?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“In most cases, it is safe to use a toner every day,” explains Dr. Portela. However, it’s important to take your skin type into account when it comes to using toner. “Whether or not toner is recommended for daily use depends on one’s skin type,” explains Dr. Engleman. “Some people can use toner every day, but people with extremely sensitive or dry skin (or certain skin conditions) may experience irritation and over-drying with daily toner use. If any of those descriptions apply to you, talk to your dermatologist about what toner is right for you and how often you should use it.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">But, generally, it is safe to use toner once or twice a day. If you are using a hydrating toner, feel free to use it twice a day. If you are using a toner with acids, start by initially introducing it into your routine two to three times a week to see how your skin responds.
