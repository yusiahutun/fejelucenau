Those days are gone, with any keystroke on a modern MacBook causing the machine to boot up. You can't even open the lid without waking a Mac up anymore!</p><p>That makes it hard to give your MacBook a good clean, which is something you'll probably want to do often to prevent oil and grime from building up. So what's the solution?</p><h2 id=use-the-lock-screen-to-disable-most-keys>Use the Lock Screen to Disable Most Keys</h2><p>If you click on Apple > Lock Screen you'll be taken to what looks like the login window, where you'll need to input your account password or use the Touch ID button to unlock. Unlocking your Watch using your Apple Watch won't be immediately available unless the laptop sleeps and wakes up again.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/lock_screen_mac.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This gives you a golden opportunity to grab&nbsp;<a href=#>your Apple-branded cleaning cloth</a>&nbsp;(or <a href=#>an alternative polishing cloth</a>) and give your keyboard a good clean. As long as you don't graze the Touch ID button with your fingertip or accidentally type your password, you'll stay on this screen without composing gibberish emails to your boss or loved ones.</p><p>This won't disable the media keys at the top of the keyboard, so you'll still be able to turn the brightness up and down or mute the volume. Keep this in mind if it seems like your screen is off after cleaning since you've probably just turned the brightness down.</p><p>Using the lock screen is the best way to clean your trackpad too since there's nothing to accidentally click.</p><h2 id=free-app-keyboardcleantool-works-too>Free App KeyboardCleanTool Works Too</h2><p>If the imperfect logging out method isn't good enough, the free app <a href=#>KeyboardCleanTool</a>&nbsp;might be a better choice. This app locks every key on your keyboard, including the top row of media keys and the Touch ID button. It doesn't disable the trackpad though, since you'll need some way of clicking the button to disable the lock.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/security_privacy_accessibility.png><p>To use the app you'll need to whitelist it under System Preferences (System Settings) > Security & Privacy > Privacy.
