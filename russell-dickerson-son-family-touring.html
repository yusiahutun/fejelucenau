"It's a vibe right now!"</p><p>At the time, the singer was looking towards another headlining string of dates on his <a href=#>She Likes It Tour</a>&nbsp;(a trek that wrapped on Dec. 10), but he hinted that he's assembling tour plans for 2023, too.</p><p>"You know me, I don't stop touring ever," he adds.</p><p>During his scant downtime, Dickerson's soaking up dad life at home with his wife Kailey and their two-year-old song, Remington.</p><p>"Oh, it's so fun right now," he admits.</p><p>"Even today, Kails went to go vote, and I had Remington. We were just wrestling around, roughhousing, sliding down the slide, everything," the singer recounts. "He goes down for a nap at 1 usually. It was, like, 3:30. [Kailey called me and] she was like, 'Why do I hear Remington in the background?' I'm like, 'Oh my God, I forgot to put him down for a nap.' We were just hanging and vibing and I completely forgot."</p><p>When Dickerson does head out on the road in 2023, Kailey and Remington will join him — the singer explains that he "always" brings his family with him while he's touring, even on the less child friendly outings, like when the singer took Remington overseas on a 16-person bus tour in Europe.</p><p>"That was not the right call," Dickerson says, without batting an eye. "We made a mistake, straight up. We did. I will admit it. But you know, we got through it, and here we are."</p><p>But a stressful touring situation is a small price to pay for spending family time together: Dickerson says that even when it's hard, time with Remington is always one of the brightest spots in his day.</p><p>"It's the best thing in the world," he relates. "We're best friends and I love every second I get to kiss his face and wrestle him. I mean, it's hard. He's two! But I don't know. It's absolutely the best thing in the world."</p><p><strong>50 Essential 2000s Country Songs:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmq62jqLKtuIydoJyjlafAsLqMrKanZZaWuqq42GarqK2inruoew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
