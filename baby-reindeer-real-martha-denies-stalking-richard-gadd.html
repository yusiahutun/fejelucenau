I was in Richard Gadd’s company on occasions but I didn’t stalk him like he claims. His story is that this is a gross intrusion into my privacy.

But it’s not like anything I’ve seen on television before. Stalking usually is depicted as someone who is kind of evil, whereas I felt like there was a vulnerable person who genuinely couldn’t stop, who for whatever reason had believed the reality that was inside her head and no matter what couldn’t change from that.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="factBoxTitleClass_f1xis0ve hm-heading">Baby Reindeer: Martha's obsession in numbers</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/dda5ca7845b0-baby-reindeer-martha.jpg><p id=elj7mED5o1m>Richard Gadd has been vocal about his stalker, named 'Martha' in the show, and just how many messages, voicemails, &nbsp;tweets and emails he received from her before contact was cut off.
