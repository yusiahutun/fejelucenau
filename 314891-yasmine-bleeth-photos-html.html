However, drug addiction got the best of her. Recent pictures of veteran actress Yasmine Bleeth show how fast time flies when you are constantly in the spotlight. One thing most fans seem to forget is age and life often catch up with their favorite actresses and a few years after their favorite movie is released, the actor or actress might not look the same.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5c6adaeafc049fb3.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Auntie Boss Actress Sasha Discloses Facebook Photo Landed Her TV Role, Says COVID-19 Hit Artistes Hard</span></p></a><h2>Yasmine Bleeth beauty makes her popular</h2><p class=align-left>While pictures of a younger Yasmine are what most people remember, her recent photos show a completely different person. It is easy to notice the transformation seeing the actress was more famous in her younger years, but she retains her heart of gold, which was nurtured from a small age.</p><h3><strong>1. Yasmine Bleeth rise to fame</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5c6adaeafc049fb3.jpg><p class=align-left>Yasmine Bleeth was born Yasmine Amanda Bleeth on 14th June 1968. This photo was taken a few years after audiences had begun to recognize her acting prowess. It is not just her acting that attracted fans but her voluptuous figure as well. Recent pictures of her show a different woman as opposed to the one in this picture seeing she has gained a little bit of weight. At the time this photo was taken, she was a star in Baywatch, a popular TV series a few years ago.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/522e520119204eec.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Nadia Mukami: 10 cutest photos of the Kenyan singer-songwriter</span></p></a><h3><strong>2. Yasmine, the model</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f823a391ac52f138.jpg><p class=align-left>There were no limits to Yasmine's potential as a young lady, as seen in her effortless poses from her modeling days. Her photogenic nature came at an early age; before she even set foot in a classroom. Yasmine was in a Johnson and Johnson TV commercial for baby shampoo, and at six years, the popular actress was on Candid Camera. She later got featured in a cosmetic advertising campaign with the likes of Cristina Ferrare, a trendy actress at the time.</p><h3><strong>3. Picture perfect</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/522e520119204eec.jpg><p class=align-left>The picture above shows just how curvy Yasmine was in her heydays. Even when on holiday, her photo could still be used to promote a product. Her beauty was nothing short of charming. She has even been featured in a popular book by iconic fashion photographer Francesco Scavullo called Scavullo Women alongside her mother at an early age. Judging by the catalog of her modeling pictures online, you can tell she had mastered the art of looking stunning in front of the camera.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a6e91818795d8ee1.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Victoria Granucci: The untold story of John Mellencamp's ex-wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Yasmine's modeling career is not to be overlooked, especially considering it helped her launch a swimwear brand called Yaz Wear. A lot of people purchased the swimwear, most of whom were Baywatch lovers and personal fans of the beautiful actress and model.</p><h2>What can we note from the Yasmine Bleeth then and now photos online?</h2><p class=align-left>A lot of actresses get slatted by the media and fans whenever changes appear on their bodies. If she gains weight and looks different from the girl they used to know, she is treated like a stranger. You would think the opposite is true, but many actresses such as Melissa McCarthy have tried it, and still got slatted despite the congratulation messages on losing weight. Yasmineâ€™s career was glamorous in the 90s, but her decline from 2001 has made it hard for her to return to the top-class actress status she formerly enjoyed.</p><h3>1. Yasmine in her prime</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/eb74d8da9f01545d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>13 seriously hot photos of Azziad Nasenya</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/3a9bce7c62684769.jpg><p class=align-left>The photo above of Yasmine in her prime shows just how elegant the actress looked. In an era where not many women were starring in films, she was a breath of fresh air in the film industry. For those wondering, how old was Yasmine Bleeth in Baywatch? As of 2020, she is 52 years old. She was a Baywatch actress from 1993 to 2003. As such, she entered the franchise at 25 and left at age 35.</p><h3>2. Yasmine at Baywatch</h3><p class=align-left>Yasmine enjoyed her time on-set and was often photographed with other cast members. The photo above was taken when she was shooting Baywatch, the series that earned her global fame. She has not been featured in many movies in recent years, but she remains one of the most memorable Baywatch actresses. If anything, her modeling career was pivotal, considering it helped jumpstart her acting career.</p><h2>A recap of the Yasmine Bleeth acting career with pictures</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/736ecdf0c669f0b6.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Yasmin Said, Maria from Citizen TV: Quick facts and photos</span></p></a><h3>1. Yasmine during her addiction</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0f949aceecb486ae.jpg><p class=align-left>There is a clear difference between Yasmine in her 90s and 2000's from the woman on the left who looks happy and content with life. She overcame her drug addiction, but at a cost. Her public image would never be the same again; nonetheless, she speaks of the addiction period as an experience today and advocates against drug use.</p><h3>2. Yasmine pictures before and after her cocaine addiction</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a6e91818795d8ee1.png><p class=align-left>The picture above shows two different versions of the same person. The image on the left shows Yasmine before her drug addiction while the one on the right shows how she changed after quitting and going to rehab. Old age might have crept in as well as her skin is not as smooth in the latter, but she maintains her dazzling smile.</p><p class=align-left>Drug addiction battles go unnoticed to the public eye, and Yaz reveals she was fighting addiction while making cameos in TV shows and movies. These include <i>Baywatch the Movie</i>, <i>Crowned</i>, <i>Dangerous</i>, <i>The Lake</i>, <i>Die For </i>and <i>Talk to Me</i> to mention a few.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/baca51402724d918.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>30 hottest actresses in Hollywood in 2022 and their pictures</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Explaining her situation, she said "I just wanted to feel good again. And I knew an easy way to get that feeling; it was like ordering Chinese food. I made one phone call, and they delivered it to my front doorâ€¦ It was all I could think about. When I was high, I didn't think about my problems. I had no pain. I wouldn't sleep for two or three days, sometimes even four or five."</p><h2>Are the Yasmine Bleeth and Matthew perry relationship and arrest rumors true?</h2><p class=align-left>Before meeting the love of her life, the Baywatch actress dated Matthew Perry for a year in 1996, and the two were spotted on several occasions publicly hand-in-hand. The union was not meant to last as they separated the same year. After Yaz sought professional help for her <a href=# title="Yasmine Bleeth addiction" rel="nofollow noopener">cocaine addiction </a>and joined a rehab center, she met her husband and former addict Paul Cerrito. Yasmine is currently married to Paul Cerrito.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c01b085ee72959b0.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Vin Diesel's wife, Paloma Jimenez: 10 fascinating facts about her</span></p></a><p class=align-left>A career in Hollywood is dependent on a lot of factors, the most important being keeping a cool head and avoiding drugs.
