Gaga responded to Tony Bennett’s death in&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an Instagram post</a>&nbsp;shared on July 30, 2023. “I will miss my friend forever. I will miss singing with him, recording with him, talking with him, being on stage together. With Tony, I got to live my life in a time warp. Tony & I had this magical power. We transported ourselves to another era, modernized the music together, & gave it all new life as a singing duo. But it wasn’t an act. Our relationship was very real. Sure he taught me about music, about showbiz life, but he also showed me how to keep my spirits high and my head screwed on straight. “Straight ahead,” he’d say. He was an optimist, he believed in quality work AND quality life. Plus, there was the gratitude…Tony was always grateful. He served in WWII, marched with Martin Luther King Jr., and sang jazz with the greatest singers and players in the world.”</p><p>You will not want to miss out on Lady Gaga <a href=# id=auto-tag_tickets data-tag=tickets>tickets</a> to her Jazz & Piano Las Vegas residency.
