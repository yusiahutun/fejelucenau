Since Charlie was dramatically found by police on Wednesday, 11 days after going missing and while his father Charles Bothuell IV was giving a live TV interview, his family have remained tight-lipped.
He was immediately taken away from his father and stepmom, Monique Dillard-Bothuell, amid claims of abuse, and given to his biological mother Africa Shippings, where he has stayed hidden."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It is usually locked from the outside</p><p>Alicia says her family had no idea Charlie was suffering any kind of abuse, but if the allegations are true, she wants Bothuell and his wife to be severely punished.</p><p>She said: ‘We want justice to be served... We had absolutely no idea anything like this was going on and if we did, as a family, we would have taken the necessary steps. We are a very tight-knit family.</p><p>‘Charlie has never said anything about any kind of abuse, but most abused kids don’t say anything. Now at least he is in an environment where he can feel safe enough to speak about it and tell the truth.’</p><p>Since the story broke many people have asked why Charlie was living with his father and not his biological mother. Alicia explained: ‘He has always been a good boy, but his grades were declining and his mother wanted to nip it in the bud and get him back on the right track.</p><p>‘She felt maybe spending more quality time with his dad might help him out. It was a decision they made together. Her only aim was to help Charlie.’</p><p>Charlie was discovered in the cramped basement behind a makeshift barrier of boxes. Confusingly, FBI agents previously searched the basement, even using specially trained cadaver dogs. It then emerged there was an underground tunnel easily accessible from the basement, connecting the other condos in the block and leading outside the building.</p><p>On Thursday MailOnline published exclusive pictures of the tunnel, including a storage area, which neighbors believe he could have hidden in. The tunnel even has a bathroom.</p><p>One neighbor said the pre-teen had been spotted out playing basketball in the neighbourhood while law enforcement and family carried out their desperate search.</p><p>The tunnel’s outside door is usually locked and only accessible to maintenance men, but crucially last week, it was apparently open so residents could get rid of a build-up of trash in a dumpster left outside.</p><img id=i-4ec43b70e24750e src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/06/27/article-2672541-1F31B16000000578-45_634x478.jpg height=478 width=634 alt="Dad under fire: Charles Bothuell IV leaves the Frank Murphy Hall of Justice on Friday after a court hearing for his wife, Monique Dillard-Bothuell" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Dad under fire: Charles Bothuell IV leaves the Frank Murphy Hall of Justice on Friday after a court hearing for his wife, Monique Dillard-Bothuell</p><img id=i-671243bdc38b1c0e src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/06/27/article-2672541-1F3060B300000578-834_634x998.jpg height=998 width=634 alt="A place to hide: Charlie probably called this storage closet home for over a week and he had access to bathroom facilities -
