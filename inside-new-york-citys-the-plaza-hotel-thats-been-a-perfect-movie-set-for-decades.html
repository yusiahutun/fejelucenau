The incredible spiral staircase, high-ceilings and breathtaking views almost seemed like they were created from a dream. But they were real, and the set was The Plaza which overlooks Central Park in the iconic setting of the Big Apple. Now, the Pinnacle Penthouses are up for sale in the high-end hotel, so we finally get a sneak peek inside we’ve always been waiting for.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-inside-the-plaza-in-new-york-city>Inside The Plaza in New York City</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/32-Stock-1024x761.jpg><p>Designed by the ‘master of the skyscraper’ Henry Janeway Hardenbergh, the hotel has been ranked by experts as the most famous hotel in the world. It probably helps it’s also been used in several Hollywood films, including <a href=#>Macaulay Culkin</a>‘s classic hits.</p><p>The building, inspired by the French Renaissance, was constructed in 1907, for $12.5 million, which was astronomical at the time. In present day, with inflation, it <a href=# rel=nofollow>has</a> the same purchasing power as $407,900.000 today. So it’d be a half-a-billion-dollar property if the chateau-style hotel was constructed in the 21st century.</p><p>Something like The Plaza isn’t just the brainchild of one man, but three. It was the dream of financier Bernhard Beinecke, president of the Fuller Construction Company Harry S Black and hotelier Fred Sterry. The trio bought a 15-year-old hotel with the same name on the site and replaced it with something that would become one of the most elegant places on the globe.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/33-Stock-1024x683.jpg><p>Standing tall with 19 stories (what was considered a skyscraper in those days) it took two years to construct. They hired Hardenberghm, known for his work on the Willard Hotel in Washington DC, The Fairmont Copley Plaza in Boston and the Dakota apartments. The designer tried to encapsulate the feeling of a French château in The Plaza at the heart of New York City.</p><p>To build the luxury site, materials were imported from Europe, including the single-largest order of gold-encrusted crystal chandeliers in history. They snapped up 1,650 chandeliers from L Straus & Sons for the job.</p><p>Opening its doors on October 1, 1907, it’s located at Fifth Avenue and Central Park South, in the most fashionable residential section of New York City.</p><p>It had a remarkable $450 million restoration in 2008, and we can look inside, thanks to <a href=# rel=nofollow>TopTenRealEstateDeals</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-nothing-unimportant-ever-happens-at-the-plaza>‘Nothing unimportant ever happens at The Plaza’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/10-Eitan-1024x683.jpg><p>The famous quote, “Nothing unimportant ever happens at The Plaza”, comes from American writer F. Scott Fitzgerald who penned the novel The Great Gatsby.</p><p>It didn’t just attract the wealthy and powerful, but <a href=#>royals</a> and celebrities.</p><p>The author is said to be a frequent patron of the bars in The Plaza when he was in New York City. He loved visiting so much, he wrote about the hotel in his most beloved novel. It’s during the lead-up to the climax of the tale when Daisy and Tom Buchanan travel to the site with Jay Gatsby, Nick Carraway and golfer Jordan. As Daisy and Gatsby have been having an affair, Gatsby asks her to tell her husband she never loved Tom, which she refuses to do. The wealth and power the couple holds is represented by the fact they travel to The Plaza on a hot summer’s day in New York City.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/7-Eitan-1024x683.jpg><p>It’s also been a favorite for Hollywood blockbusters, including the likes of Alfred Hitchcock’s North by Northwest (1959), and The Way We Were (1973). Woody Allen then stepped into The Plaza for the flick The Front in 1976, with the movie set in the 1950s of New York City.</p><p>Now, one of the most recent movies that most of us remember, is <a href=#>Home Alone 2</a>, (1992), as well as the romance Sleepless in Seattle the following year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/3-Travis-1024x683.jpg><p>Interestingly, <a href=#>Anne Hathaway</a> and Kate Hudson’s film Bride Wars was set at The Plaza but was mostly filmed in their Boston sister property because the New York City estate was having renovations.</p><p>Circling back to Gatsby, <a href=#>Leonardo DiCaprio</a>, Tobey Maguire and the rest of the cast of Baz Luhrman’s rendition of the Jazz Age story returned in 2013 for their scenes.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-donald-trump-even-bought-the-hotel>Donald Trump even bought the hotel</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/12-Eitan-1024x683.jpg><p>Former President of the United States purchased The Plaza for $407.5 million in 1998, two years after it was declared a National Historic Monument.</p><p>He said at the time: “It isn’t just a building, it’s the ultimate work of art”.</p><p><a href=#>Donald Trump</a> declared he was “in love with it”, and ordered renovations that stayed true to the American historic essence and Roman architecture. They added new chandeliers, a Japanese restaurant and bar and a fitness center. Magnificent onyx was installed in every bathroom, and wall-to-wall carpeting from the lobby was removed for the mosaics to shine through underneath.</p><p>He <a href=# rel=nofollow>sold</a> the site in 1995.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-pinnacle-penthouses-up-for-sale>Pinnacle Penthouses up for sale</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/17-Eitan-1024x684.jpg><p>At the top of New York City’s The Plaza hotel sits the famous double penthouses.
