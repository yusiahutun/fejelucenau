We don't have your email or your phone number, so we're gonna just play a little."</p><p>However, Underwood didn't publicly respond to the request at the time, and she still hasn't said anything about the proposal officially. But during a recent <a href=#>CMT Hot 20 Countdown</a> appearance, the Florida Georgia Line members&nbsp;revealed that the superstar&nbsp;had indeed&nbsp;declined the team-up.</p><p>“No, we got turned down on that one," Hubbard&nbsp;says while staying good-natured. "You don't win 'em all. I guess she didn't love it as much as we did, but that's alright."</p><p>He continued putting on a brave face about the rejection, ribbing with&nbsp;host Cody Alan, "We got turned down, we got turned down."</p><p>"I think she said it was amazing and she'd love to, but it was right around her book tour release and so she was super busy and didn't really have time," he adds, "But who knows, who knows where it will go. Now it's just open game."</p><p>Not to worry, though, since Florida Georgia Line have plenty of other high-profile collaborations under their belts. In the past, they've worked with the likes of <a href=#>Luke Bryan</a>, <a href=#>Justin Bieber</a>, <a href=#>Backstreet Boys</a> and more.</p><p><strong>See the Top 50 Country Duets of All Time!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmn6Sfp7alrYygnKiql56ubrjIp5xmm5Gnv6qxjK6lnZ2irLywsIycpqWkkZe8s63ToqanZaSqv6%2Bxw2abqK%2BeZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
