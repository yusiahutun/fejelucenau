Coronavirus: TraceTogether data used in murder case, Singapore minister says as he defends police access to contact-tracing programme
Jia Hui had first consulted Crime Library Singapore, where a small team of volunteers use social media to help reunite family members who have lost contact with each other, and seek witnesses in murder or missing-persons cases."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

In Jia Hui’s replies, sent through Crime Library founder Joseph Tan, she said her family had grappled with guilt for the past two decades.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“My parents feel guilty for not taking good care of my sister,” she said. “My father passed away in 2016, and as for my mother, she cries every time she thinks of my sister. She tries not to think by working in her own coffee shop from dusk to dawn, tiring herself out before sleeping. It’s been like that for 20 years.”</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2020/12/16/clean_0.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">01:16</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Japan’s ‘Twitter killer’ sentenced to death for killing and dismembering nine people</p><p>Japan’s ‘Twitter killer’ sentenced to death for killing and dismembering nine people</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Jia Hui’s parents twice went to the police for updates on their daughter’s case, once in the late 1990s and again in 2014, but were told they would be contacted if there were new developments in the case.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Things changed when Ahmad Danial Mohamed Rafa’ee, 35, was charged in December for the murder of Felicia Teo Wei Ling, who was 19 years old when she disappeared in 2007.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I read Felicia Teo’s case and discussed it with my mother before reaching out to Crime Library Singapore. I told her that the technology today is better than before. If Felicia’s case can be solved, why not my sister’s?” Jia Hui said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On Monday, the police told The Straits Times that Shiow Rong’s case had been reviewed several times since 1995, and that they would work to verify the new tip-offs that had come in this month. In the previous reviews, they said, they had looked into all “information provided by members of the public or the deceased’s family, and leveraged advancements in forensic technology”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Tan from Crime Library told This Week in Asia two informants had come forward after Jia Hui’s media interviews and their details had been given to the police. One claimed to be a regular patron at her mother’s drinks stall and said they had information on a suspect that matched the police’s photofit released in 1995.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">COLD CASE BREAKTHROUGH</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Singapore is one of the safest cities in the world, coming in second behind Tokyo in The Economist Intelligence Unit’s Safe Cities Index 2019. Nine homicides were recorded in 2018, amounting to 0.2 cases for every 100,000 people, compared with five cases per 100,000 people in the United States and 1.1 in Britain that year, according to the latest available data from the United Nations.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">From 2015 to 2019, the city state saw an average of 1,851 missing persons reported a year, according to data from the Singapore police, which declined to provide statistics for murders.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When Jia Hui’s appeal once again drew attention to Shiow Rong’s case, public interest was also rekindled in other unsolved murders. These included <span class="c1 css-1mniedq eq9i9439" data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-1>18-year-old Winnifred Teo’s death in 1985 after she went out for an evening run, and that of Dini Haryati, 19, who was raped and strangled in 1997 and found dressed only in a white T-shirt with her body covered in bruises.</span></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Felicia Teo’s remains were never found, but when news that she had been murdered came to light, social media was abuzz with sympathetic netizens and armchair sleuths offering theories about what happened and their hopes that the responsible party would be brought to justice.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She disappeared on June 29, 2007, after a visit to a friend’s flat at night, and was reported missing on July 3. Teo was at the flat with two men, who claimed she had left in the wee hours of the night. Despite a search and reviews of closed-circuit television footage, police did not find incriminating evidence.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Takahiro Shiraishi, Japan’s Twitter killer, hopes to marry ‘normal girl’ before execution</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In a December statement, the police explained that Teo’s case was reviewed in July last year and then referred to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), as part of a process involving selected cases unsolved “for a protracted period of time”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The CID uncovered new leads while tracing items believed to be in Teo’s possession when she went missing, one of which was later linked to the man they subsequently arrested and charged.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Preliminary investigations revealed that Felicia had died before the report was lodged on July 3, 2007, and that the suspect had allegedly disposed of Felicia’s body subsequently with the male friend,” the statement said, adding that the search for her remains is ongoing.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The police are also currently trying to locate the male friend, who is believed to not currently be in Singapore.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2020/12/23/clean_0.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">03:01</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Family mourns mother and son shot at point-blank range by Philippine policeman over noise dispute</p><p>Family mourns mother and son shot at point-blank range by Philippine policeman over noise dispute</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">SEEKING ANSWERS</strong></p>Gregory Vijayendran, a Singapore-based senior counsel who has been practising <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">law</span></a> for 27 years, said unsolved murders were rare in the country, with only one or two cases per decade.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In such cases, he said, family members could – through their own sleuthing and the help of organisations such as Crime Library Singapore as well as members of the public – search for clues or leads that could be passed on to the police investigating officer (IO).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Beyond that, there is little else they could do. The state has powers of investigation and compelling document production. A private person has no such recourse. At best, they can follow up diligently and regularly with the IO until … a decision is made by the Attorney General’s Chamber to bring charges against individuals or close the file.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While each case varies, Vijayendran said the closure of a file could be influenced by the coroner’s verdict, such as a ruling of death by misadventure. A coroner’s inquiry was often conducted in cases where a death occurred under suspicious circumstances, he added.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But unlike civil cases, there was no statute of limitation or time bar for criminal cases in Singapore, Vijayendran said, adding: “Once a crime, always a crime.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Tan of Crime Library Singapore said he had helped more than 100 families pursue cold missing-persons and murder cases since 2000.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One challenge he often faced was overcoming the family members’ fear of speaking up about the matter, he said. Sometimes families would come to him and then later change their minds about pursuing the matter.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In Shiow Rong’s case, her sister Jia Hui, having grown up, “had the courage to pursue this”, though he said the family still had concerns about their own safety.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Sometimes, the victim’s next of kin does not want to face any repercussion [over the incident being publicised], as the killer is still at large,” Tan said. “Many Singaporeans are still afraid of so-called retribution, afraid that the killer will come for them.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kxKaxymaYrKGRZL2mu8%2BlnGiZoqm2pLjEaGpqaWhthnN7wqijnWWTlsCmv4ywmKulXaGyorDSZqqippeWvbC%2BxGasp6ufocOmsIymrKuclafAbrjIpmSsoJmkxG6%2Bzqee</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
