"Our body naturally has a lot of hyaluronic acid (HA) in it; it forms tissue firmness and is in lots of cells, but as we age the quantities deplete and the structure of our face changes. The use of fillers is to replace this loss of volume."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The HA in fillers comes in many different forms: some are very firm and rigid "for places that need more structural support like the jawline or temples" says Dr Christou, and others are a lot softer and more fluid, "and therefore have a lot more hydrating capacity". These would be used for areas like the under eyes "where we don't want anything firm or bulky but instead we want to plump and hydrate the area".</p><h2 data-node-id=2 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">The different types of dermal filler</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Most dermal fillers are pure HA, and there are a few brands that have become household names due to their popularity with leading doctors.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Juvederm, perhaps the best known, produces a range of fillers for various uses in different areas of the face. Voluma, for example, is firmer and therefore best for areas like the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/skincare/a30593390/jaw-filler/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=jawline class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">jawline</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/skincare/a42049090/cheek-filler/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=cheekbone class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">cheekbone</a> to provide sturdiness and mimic the shape. Volbella is much softer and supple, best for filling lines around the mouth or for use in the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/a26622115/lip-fillers/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=lips class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">lips</a>. Juvederm also produces Volite, which is a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/skincare/a29759932/profhilo/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=skin-booster class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">skin-booster</a>, similar to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/skincare/a29759932/profhilo/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Profhilo class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Profhilo</a> (from Ibsa Derma).</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Another big brand is Teoxane, a favourite of Dr Wassim Taktouk, an aesthetic doctor famed for his delicate and subtle use of filler. "They've been groundbreaking in their research and development in dermal fillers, and I only want the best for my patients," he says of Teoxane, which created its products with the ability to "stretch within the tissues while the face animates, resulting in sophisticated and undetectable results".</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A newer brand is HArmonyCA, a filler that combines HA with calcium hydroxyapatite (CA), a complex that stimulates your fibroblasts and growth factors, meaning the plumping effects continue for up to two years. Best used around the outer jaw and temples, it can do wonders for lifting and ‘opening up’ a tired-looking face.</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for #SkinSchool: A guide to retinol" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/bd335e54-93e9-40ca-ba40-9a99ed1bc388/thumb_1920x1080_00002_1580825138_16637.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 data-node-id=9 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">How dermal fillers are used</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As noted by Dr Christou, as we age, our faces lose volume (due to depleting collagen and elastin) and start to droop (due to gravity). Additionally our bones actually shrink, resulting in a sagging and an increasingly deflated look. While all perfectly natural, should it be a concern then fillers can help to address this. "Our understating of the ageing process has expanded significantly and we now understand how bone and fat loss contribute to facial ageing" says Dr Wassim. "With this knowledge we are able to rejuvenate our patients in keeping with their natural aesthetic by targeting the areas of change."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Filler should always be used to replace volume, not add extra, says Dr Christou. "By using dermal filler to replace the loss, what you're going to achieve is a softening of the facial features." This should therefore mean a look that's "fresh, healthier, lifted and sculpted without distorting the face and disrupting the balance".</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">The other benefits of dermal filler</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When the filler is injected (and then manipulated into place – more on that below), you'll see the results immediately where they have sculpted, lifted and generally perked up the face. One of the big plus sides of filler, compared to other volumising treatments, is that you see the change straight away. There's no waiting, or trying to analyse weeks or months later if a procedure you had really did make a difference.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Dr Taktouk adds that another bonus is their versatility; "they have a high safety profile, and can be used for so many different concerns". As well as volume loss and lifting, they can rebalance an 'uneven' face. "They're also suitable for all skin types and colours", he adds.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=17 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">How fillers are injected, and how it feels</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Depending on the filler viscosity and where it is being injected, it can be done with just a fine needle, but often a cannula (a flexible tube) is used to direct the filler more precisely under the skin. "Often I'll combine the use of injection techniques around the face" says Dr Joanna, "as it gives a more bespoke, refined result and I can be more controlled with how I place the filler".</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the right hands, the process of injecting dermal filler should be practically painless. Numbing cream is advised, which will take the sting out of the injections, so you should only feel a small sharp scratch at injection points.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This being said, the use of a cannula can feel a bit... odd. As the liquid is being directed into the areas, the cannula will move around and your doctor will then manually 'manipulate' the filler into place. This isn't painful, but can feel strange.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Post-procedure, the treated areas can feel tender for up to a week, and some slight bruising may occur.</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for #SkinSchool: A guide to retinol" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/bd335e54-93e9-40ca-ba40-9a99ed1bc388/thumb_1920x1080_00002_1580825138_16637.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 data-node-id=23 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">How long filler lasts, and when to top-up</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The effects of most dermal fillers should last for at least a year, if not up to 18 months, as the HA is gradually broken down, metabolised and excreted. Factors like metabolism rates can affect their longevity.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Top-ups are therefore advised around that time when the filler is visibly gone, however some doctors, like Dr Christou, offer a kind of maintenance instead. "My preference in topping up is to do regular micro treatments" say Dr Christou. By that she means that instead of letting all of the filler completely break down leaving you back to square one, "most of my patients come back to me once or twice a year for dinky, sprinkle-effect filler dotted in where it's needed". This, she feels, avoids the risk of overfilling.</p><h2 data-node-id=26 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">What can go wrong with fillers?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Dermal fillers have gained a bad reputation over the years, and it's not entirely unjustified. Celebrities with comedy puffed-up cheeks and duck lips were common place. "People can be scared of fillers, and that they'll look unnatural or fake, because they've seen so much bad work and inappropriate overfilling," says Dr Wassim. "But what you need to remember is that the good work goes unnoticed." An excellent practitioner will err on the side of caution, and turn away any patient who isn't a suitable candidate.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Fillers are best used when proper assessment of the anatomy has been undertaken," says Dr Joanna. "Rather than filling cheeks for sake of it, you can actually look at a face and identify where the loss of volume has occurred – rather than adding where it isn't required."</p><h2 data-node-id=29 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">What to ask your doctor when considering filler</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Firstly, a patient should research their practitioner, check relevant registrations, experience, reviews, and ask to see before-and-afters" advises Dr Taktouk. "I recommend that they don't have the treatment at an initial consultation, but instead take home the information and make sure any questions and concerns have been answered before booking in for the actual treatment." He also recommends asking which filler is being injected, and ensuring the practitioner has a good answer as to why they've chosen that option.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">You should also consider what results you're looking for, as – depending on the skin concern – other treatments such as <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/skincare/a38813523/baby-botox/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="toxin injections" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">toxin injections</a> (like Botox), <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/skincare/a29759932/profhilo/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="skin boosters" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">skin boosters</a> or <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/skincare/a42406827/softwave-skin-treatment-review/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="skin tightening" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">skin tightening</a> might be better suited. And, first and foremost, skin health should always take priority: if your skin is unhappy, injectables could just be a temporary plaster over the problem.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwrsSarK2xX6i4qrrCmqmeZ5FpgHeBknBpa2eUmr%2BurctmnaKknJq%2FtHnGrqCdnV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
