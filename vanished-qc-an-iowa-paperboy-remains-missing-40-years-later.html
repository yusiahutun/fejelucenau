Another paperboy said he saw Johnny talking with a &nbsp;stocky man in a blue two-toned car near the paper drop. Yet another witness says Johnny told him the man was asking for directions and that a man was following Johnny,</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2022/05/Johnny-Gosch-and-Eugene-Martin-poster.jpg><p>John and Noreen Gosch began to receive phone calls from customers about papers that hadn’t been delivered. John found Johnny’s wagon with newspapers two block from their home.</p><p>In March 1983, a woman in Tulsa, Oklahoma, said Johnny ran up to her. He was being chased by two men. “Please, lady, help me!” he said. “My name is John David Gosch.”</p><p>The two men dragged by boy away.</p><p>In 1984, Eugene Martin, another Des Moines-area paperboy, vanished while he was delivering papers. That case remains cold, too.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2022/05/Johnny-Gosch-age-progressed.jpg><p>His mother, Noreen Gosch, has said he visited her in 1997 and told her he had been a victim of a pedophile ring – that he lived under an assumed identity because he did not think it was safe to come home.</p><p>Noreen Gosch lobbied for “The Johnny Gosch Bill,” state legislation that mandated an immediate police response to reports of missing children. It became law in Iowa in 1984, and similar laws were passed in Missouri and other states.</p><p>If you have any information to share involving Johnny Gosch’s disappearance, please call any law enforcement agency and mention his name.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46cqaKllWTDorrIrJ%2BenF2msG6tzWagqK%2BRYr2ivMSrmaixXaeyrq3Ip6pmpZmowKq6xmZraWWpmq6zv4ylmK2domQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
