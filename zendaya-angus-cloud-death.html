Zendaya made a tribute post to her co-star on <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.instagram.com/p/Cvaft3SL4Zr/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Instagram</a>, “Words are not enough to describe the infinite beauty that is Angus (Conor),” She captioned the post. I’m so grateful I got the chance to know him in this life, to call him a brother, to see his warm kind eyes and bright smile, or hear his infectious cackle of a laugh (I’m smiling now just thinking of it) I know people use this expression often when talking about folks they love…“they could light up any room they entered” but boy let me tell you, he was the best at it. I’d like to remember him that way. For all of the boundless light, love and joy he always managed to give us. I’ll cherish every moment.</p><p>She continued, “My heart is with his mother and family at this time and please be kind and patient as grief looks different for everyone.”</p><p>In an interview with <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=URL data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjTuf6C4Q3w">Access Hollywood</a>, Cloud gushed about working with Zendaya. “It’s really an honor to work with her and it makes the work so much easier. She’s doing the acting, I really just gotta sit there and react, you know, and I’m like blessed, you know. It’s the back-and-forth, you need that energy and she always brings that positive ready-to-work hustle.” He also shared the same sentiment with <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/07/236532/euphoria-fez-drug-dealer-angus-cloud-interview>Refinery 29.</a> “She really supported me to make me feel comfortable. I was nervous, you know?” Euphoria was his first major acting role.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Zendaya and Cloud also went to the same high school Oakland School for the Arts together.&nbsp;“We had some of the same friends I guess, but I didn’t really know her,” he says. While in high school he built sets and did lighting and sound for the theater department. “We did&nbsp;Rent. That’s what it’s called, right? It was cool.”</p><p>Zendaya’s raw portrayal of Rue garnered critical acclaim and won her two Emmy Awards for Best Actress in a Drama Series. “I get very emotional about I &nbsp;because I care about her a lot because she represents a lot of people that need a lot of love,” she told<a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://variety.com/2022/scene/columns/euphoria-zendaya-jacob-elordi-1235237591/ rel="noreferrer noopener"> Variety.</a> “And she represents part of myself, and she represents part of [‘Euphoria’ creator]&nbsp;Sam&nbsp;[Levinson]. That that means a lot to me, and I just want people to be able to heal through her.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/sam-levinson-angus-cloud.jpg><p>In a statement to&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>NBC News</a>, Sam Levinson released a statement about the Cloud’s death. “There was no one quite like Angus. He was too special, too talented and way too young to leave us so soon,” Levinson said. “He also struggled, like many of us, with addiction and depression. I hope he knew how many hearts he touched. I loved him. I always will. Rest in peace and God Bless his family.”</p><p>Javon “Wanna” Walton, who played Cloud’s on-screen adoptive little brother Ashtray on&nbsp;Euphoria, made two <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://stylecaster.com/lists/euphoria-cast-angus-cloud-death/sam-levinson-creator-of-euphoria/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram tributes </a>on July 31, 2023. “rest easy brother❤️🕊️,” he captioned a post. He also made an Instagram story with the caption “Forever Family.” Alexa Demie who plays Maddie on Euphoria posted a black Instagram story with a broken heart emoji on July 31, 2023.</p><p>Colman Domingo, who portrays Ali Muhammad on&nbsp;Euphoria, shared a photo of the cast posing together on his Instagram “That was his smile. That was him. May he rest sweetly in peace.””And that was his smile. That was him. May he rest sweetly in peace.”</p><p>He also made a subsequent Instagram story with the caption, “Couldn’t be more real, original and sweet. Loved this kid. Always smiles. I hope this sensitive soul is at rest.” He also added, “Check on loved ones. Check on them.”</p><p>Executive producer Drake made an Instagram story as a tribute to the 25-year-old actor. He posted a picture of the actor and called him a “good soul.”</p><p>Maude Apatow, who starred opposite Cloud in&nbsp;Euphoria&nbsp;as Lexi—eventually Fezco’s love interest—said “Fexi” was partly due to her IRL chemistry/friendship with her co-star. “When Sam and I were talking about all this stuff, just on the phone kicking around for hours, that came to be. I can’t remember specifically how that went down. Once we started talking about it, it totally made sense,” she told&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Entertainment Weekly</a>&nbsp;in February 2022. “And Angus and I, in real life, have a funny friendship. It all just happened. It all felt right as soon as we started talking about it.”</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.gq.com/story/euphoria-season-2-premiere-fezco-episode-angus-cloud-interview rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GQ,</a> he talked about how his character was only supposed to stick around for the first season. “I don’t know, but apparently, because they cast me off the street, I guess the character of Fezco was [never meant to stick around]. I don’t even know how. I never saw that script. No one ever told me. It was one day when we were filming the pilot that I think Jacob told me, he was like, “Oh yeah, you didn’t know? Your character gets [imitates brains getting blown out].” And yeah, it never ended up happening. I think that they liked what I did and so they decided to keep me alive and let me rock. I don’t know how I was going out, but hopefully I would’ve gone out like a G.”</p><p>If you or someone you know is experiencing a mental health crisis, help is available.
