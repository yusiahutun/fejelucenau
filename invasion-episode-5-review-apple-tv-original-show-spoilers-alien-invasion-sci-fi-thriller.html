Apple TV+ just dropped the fifth episode of 'Invasion' and we have mixed reactions. The show has been incredibly slug-paced so far with barely any aliens or references to the invasion in this sci-fi thriller. Fans too have been disappointed as they ask for the actual invading to begin.
'Invasion' deals with extraterrestrials who ascend on Earth leaving mankind in confusion. Now, five episodes equalling five hours into the show and we finally are being given the faintest of hopes that the show will pick soon."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He gets a nasty shock upon finding orders of an emergency evacuation after failing miserably to get any help after radioing for an evacuation. We get to see that the notice mentions that the army came into contact with an unknown hostile presence. The show is finally heading towards the correct path of realizing they're not alone. Aneesha (Golshifteh Farahani), meanwhile, heads out alone to search for supplies and food leaving her family behind in the house. Circumstances see her escorted by the army to help the injured when she lies about being a doctor (she went to medical school, but isn't practicing). In Tokyo, Mitsuki(Shioli Kutsuna) sneaks back into JASA where she finds out the people that took over are linguists with her boss confirming the presence of aliens which were likely behind the HOSHI shuttle getting destroyed. Meanwhile, Casper(Billy Barratt) and the other students split up, with half of them staying back and the other half including Casper going ahead to find the route back home.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/aef4dfbb-ebcf-437a-9831-2f9d9957791a.png><p>The latest episode finally saw the aliens and the invasion that the show is all about. Aneesha's plotline gets better as she is away from her family. We were honestly getting sick of the family drama and her out on her own was refreshing to see. Her finding of a foreign object in a patient's wound looked eerily like a tiny alien body which actually managed to thrill us a tad bit. Mitsuki's plotline continues to be the most interesting to date as she has been the most on track towards realizing that the happenings are not terrorist-related but something else entirely. JASA and its story continue to give us hope of this show getting interesting. We would like to see more on Casper as this is one character that needs to be explored more. Trevante's story has been on the boring side as we see him drive about in the desert. The episode was a big relief to fans as the President confirms the presence of aliens on earth with the world FINALLY knowing about them instead of being confused for four episodes straight.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/862f4729-cb78-40e2-8c3a-fefdd6b6f4e4.png><p>The fifth episode was slow-paced as per usual and left us wanting more. We have hopes that the show will pick up from here on with the existence of aliens finally confirmed.</p><p>'Invasion' is streaming on Apple TV+ with new episodes released every Friday.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRooZ6rrrS1zqdknqiZqLylsYxuZKudpp6yuHnAqaelnV2pw2670aKeoqaRoXq0tM6wZKyon565pr7SZpiloZWjeqq61ZqqoqeeYsCktYyfoGasmKe2rbjEqw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
