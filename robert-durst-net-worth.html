Then, in 2021, he was found guilty of killing his friend and confidant, Susan Berman. And in 2022, Kathlie’s family came for <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Robert Durst’s net worth</a>.</p><p>Durst was born in New York City on April 12, 1943, into a wealthy family known for its real estate empire. Durst’s father Seymour Durst was a prominent property developer and the head of The Durst Organization. The <a href=#>family was exceptionally affluent</a> and the young Durst attended prestigious schools, including the Horace Mann School in New York City and Lehigh University in Pennsylvania, where he graduated with a degree in economics.</p><p>His connection to several suspicious deaths was the subject of The Jinx documentary series by Andrew Jarecki. In the series’ final moments, he <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>seemingly confesses to three murders on a live mic</a> while in the bathroom: “There it is. You’re caught. … What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course.”</p><p>Durst was arrested in 2015 in connection with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the murder of his friend Susan Berman</a>, who was found shot to death in her Los Angeles home in 2000. Durst was accused of killing Berman to prevent her from revealing information about Kathleen McCormack Durst’s disappearance. He was convicted in 2021 and sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. He died behind bars in 2022 at age 78.</p><p>Now, with The Jinx Part Two premiering on MAX on April 22, 2024, we finally get an explanation for the mystery of his arrest. Here’s what we know about <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Robert Durst’s net worth</a>, including who inherited his fortune after he died in prison.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.83490566037736><h2>Robert Durst's net worth</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/nick-chavin-susan-berman-robert-durst.jpeg><p>Robert Durst’s net worth was <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>estimated to be $100 million</a>, per the New York Times, which is a drop in the ocean compared to that of the Durst empire—Forbes magazine estimates the family’s fortune at $8.1 billion. The Durst family owns more <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">than 16 million square feet of real estate</a> in New York and Philadelphia, including a 10 percent stake in One World Trade Center.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.46393034825871><h2>Who inherited Robert Durst's fortune?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Debrah-Lee-Charatan.jpg><p>Who inherited Robert Durst’s money? Durst left his fortune to Debrah Lee Charatan, his wife at the time of his death. Ironically, the day of Charatan’s hearing to become the executor of his estate fell on the 40th anniversary of his first wife Kathie Durst’s disappearance. She was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">declared legally dead in 2017</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=7.6958174904943><h2>Kathie Durst's family's lawsuit</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/robert-durst.jpg><p>In 2022, Kathie Durst’s family sought more than $100 million from Durst’s estate and widow in a wrongful death suit. Robert Abrams, the family’s attorney, claimed Charatan quietly married Durst in 2000 to help him evade authorities after the investigation into Kathie Durst’s disappearance was reopened.</p><p>Abrams said the suit is an “<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>important step toward justice for Kathie</a> and toward exposing the corruption that allowed Robert Durst to go unpunished,” adding that once Charatan was appointed executor, she would “apparently seek to collect the balance of her husband’s interest in the Durst family Trusts, which we believe was promised to Ms. Charatan in exchange for helping Robert Durst evade justice in connection with the murders of Kathie, Susan Berman, and Morris Black.”</p><p>He also told the Associated Press: “We’re not about to let Debrah Charatan dissolve the trust and get tens of millions of dollars more. You don’t get tens of millions of dollars in America for covering up a murder.”</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfp7yjsdGtZJ2toqjBbrrErWSwp6KptXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
