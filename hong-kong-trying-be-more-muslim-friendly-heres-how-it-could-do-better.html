The efforts to promote Muslim-friendly options should not be seen solely as a means to attract Muslim visitors and businesspeople to the city."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It is equally important to create an environment that embraces cultural diversity and respects different religious practices.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One critical aspect that requires attention is the misconception that pork-free food automatically qualifies as halal. Halal requirements encompass the sourcing, preparation, handling and serving of food according to Islamic dietary rules. Restaurants offering halal food should obtain proper certification.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">During the holy month of Ramadan, when Muslims in Hong Kong fast for about 13 hours a day, there were limited halal-certified dining options in the city. To my knowledge, not a single hotel in Hong Kong offered a halal buffet dinner where Muslims could go to break their fast, or invite their friends, unlike in neighbouring countries where indulging in hotel iftar buffets is a common practice.</p>Hong Kong currently lacks a <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">halal certification system administered by the government</span></a>. The existing process overseen by the Islamic Community Fund is considered too restrictive, resulting in only 105 certified restaurants. It would be beneficial for the Hong Kong government to establish a task force to oversee this issue, creating a more systematic approach.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Hong Kong Tourism Board has taken steps to better educate the local industry on Muslim dietary requirements through briefings. The city is also working on developing an improved halal accreditation framework.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This proactive approach is encouraging, especially as Hong Kong aims to attract more travellers from the Middle East, a strategic region in terms of tourism and investment. The Tourism Board could set up a working group dedicated to making the city a top Muslim-friendly travel destination in the region.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the meantime, despite having a small Muslim population, South Korea aims to tap into the demand for halal products, driven by the influence of Korean pop culture in Southeast Asia and the interest in Korean cuisine. The country’s government has been supporting businesses in this endeavour by providing help such as food ingredient analysis, subsidies for certification fees and promotional events.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">South Korean companies, including food giants like Lotte Foods and CJ CheilJedang, have already introduced halal-certified products to cater to Muslim consumers. Despite some challenges, there is optimism about the potential of the halal market in South Korea and the opportunities it presents for cultural exchange and tolerance.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ilnur Minakhmetov, Yau Ma Tei</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Check air quality near excavation work</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I am concerned about the exhaust fumes that seem to be generated by the excavation work being undertaken in proximity to the eastern entrance to One IFC. These fumes have on a number of occasions blown through the overhead walkway. Although this is wind-dependent, it is pronounced enough that one can detect the pollution.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I hope the Environmental Protection Department can look into this and see that the fumes are contained.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ken Mortell, San Po Kong</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kvLG1zaKmp2ecmsG1sdGsZpqqpJ6wrbGObGlucGdohHC0zqeeZqOfo7RuwNGyoKefXZeybrnOq5xmpaWouaq5jJ%2Bpop2embm6eceeqZ6rXZ28uHnIrWScp6WhsW6wzmaZnqykmr8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
