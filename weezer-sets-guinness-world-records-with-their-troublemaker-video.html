Guinness World Records official, Stuart Claxton, was in attendance to monitor and certify these record attempts during the day long shoot in Los Angeles, where new records were set for Largest Game of Dodgeball, Most People in a Custard Pie Fight, Most People Riding on a Skateboard, Largest Air Guitar Ensemble, and Longest Guitar Hero World Tour Marathon. (See below for more details on these records.) The band's Pat Wilson is also shown in the video playing the World's Smallest Drum Kit in a Video…a record the band is petitioning to get in the book as an official record. No word yet at press time. The video's exclusive 24-hour online premiere will be available on Yahoo!Music beginning at 9:00PM PDT Monday, October 6, 2008.</p><p>The "Troublemaker" video is for a song that's been steadily rising up the Modern Rock charts, currently at #2 and looks to follow its predecessor, "Pork And Beans" to the very top of that chart. "Pork And Beans" spent a record eleven weeks on the top of the chart and its accompanying video has been played over fifteen million times.</p><p>Both "Pork and Beans" and "Troublemaker" are from the band's latest Top 5 album Weezer (referred to as The Red Album). The album is the band's boldest and most fearless to date, with the band experimenting with their sound as they never have in the past.</p><p>Weezer recently began its first tour in three years starting a five-week sojourn of North America starting September 23 in Boston and played a show in New York's Madison Square Garden on the 24th. The tour continues for a few more weeks and includes a stop at Los Angeles' Forum on October 14.</p><p>The shows have incorporated a "Hootenanny" where 30 radio station winners perform two songs on stage with the band during the show. It gives those lucky musicians the legitimate right to say to their friends sentences like "Yep, I rocked Madison Square Garden with my pals Weezer."</p><p>Reviews for the show have been universally great. The Boston Globe in a review of the tour's first show, ""Even a little rusty, we're still the coolest band in the world," Weezer frontman Rivers Cuomo crowed from the Tsongas Arena stage Tuesday night. After the power-pop quartet's undeniably zesty 100-minute set, kicking off a North American tour, it was hard to argue the point."</p><p><b>The Guinness World Records:</b></p><p>Largest Air Guitar Ensemble<br>The largest air guitar ensemble consisted of 233 participants and took place during during the filming of the music video "Troublemaker" by the band Weezer in Los Angeles, California, USA on 21 August 2008.</p><p>Largest Game of Dodgeball<br>The largest game of dodgeball consisted of two teams of 50 people (100 total) who played against each other during the filming of the music video "Troublemaker" by the band Weezer in Los Angeles, California, USA, on 21 August 2008.</p><p>Longest Guitar Hero World Tour Marathon<br>The longest Guitar Hero World Tour Marathon lasted for 10 hr 12 min 54 sec during the filming of the music video "Troublemaker" by the band Weezer in Los Angeles, California,USA, on 21</p><p>August 2008.</p><p>Most People in a Custard Pie Fight<br>The most people in a custard pie fight was 120 during the filming of the music video "Troublemaker" by the band Weezer in Los Angeles, California, USA, on 21 August 2008.</p><p>Most People Riding on a Skateboard<br>The most people riding on a skateboard is 22 during the filming of the music video "Troublemaker" by the band Weezer in Los Angeles, California, USA, on 21 August 2008. –by CelebrityAccess Staff Writers</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaJuRlr%2BktMivnGivlZrHpr6MrJytq12cwqq6zZ6qrGWnpL%2BtsIyrnJynopnAbsPIrZ9mrJiatrN506umrpqcmrqit8SrZK%2BhlJq8cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
