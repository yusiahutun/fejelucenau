She joined her husband and her mother Doria Ragland at the <a class=hm-link href=#>Woman Of Vision Awards</a> in New York on May 16, where she wore a stunning <a class=hm-link href=#>golden pencil dress</a> from Johanna Ortiz with a strapless neckline, keyhole cutout and front split. She added metallic accessories including matching gold heels from Tom Ford, her Cartier 'Love' bracelet and a contrasting silver bracelet, finishing off her look with just a few delicate bands to each hand.&nbsp;</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Meghan and Harry make very unusual entrance at Ms. Foundation Awards</figure><p id=eUYhm4p8_1g data-wc=42>The diamond-studded ring on her left hand was thought to have been given to Meghan on her first wedding anniversary and was nestled alongside her Welsh gold wedding ring, made from the same nugget as Princess Kate's and the late Queen Elizabeth's.</p><p id=eLMYx1StJs2 data-wc=62>Normally sitting centre stage on her ring finger is her trilogy engagement ring, which features a diamond from Princess Diana's collection flanked by two rocks from Botswana.

Because I had to ask permission from my grandmother, I couldn't do it outside of the UK," he began. "I did pop a bottle of champagne while she was roasting a chicken and that kind of slightly gave the game away."</p><p id=eR3NCxYAQaa2 data-wc=58>He then set up a secret picnic blanket outside surrounded by electric candles and white flowers. "In the little walled garden, overlooked by the staff flats, I got 15 of those electric candles," Harry explained. A photo showed the royal on one knee holding a ring box in one hand and Meghan's pet dog Guy in the other.</p><p id=ePRiVS77AL-q data-wc=51>"It wasn't that I knew she'd say yes, but she'd already moved Guy over so I had Guy as a hostage. And he was in stilts so he couldn't run away," he quipped, with a green jacket-clad Meghan leaning in for a selfie with Harry and her pooch following their engagement.</p><p id=e0E6kkFoBNWj data-wc=7><strong>See more photos from Meghan's latest appearance...</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7f41564de620-gettyimages-1490796993.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/abaf57c916c2-meghan-harry-doria.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/de51014c246f-markus-anderson-genevieve-hillis-meghan.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/32fddc232b4c-meghan-gold-dress.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c32f8f29e6d9-meghan-markle-award.jpg><p id=eLwS_yYIfkU data-wc=26><strong>Planning your wedding?
