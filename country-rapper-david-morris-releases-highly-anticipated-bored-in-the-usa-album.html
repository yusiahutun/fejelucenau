I’ve always had a very eclectic taste in music. I grew up burning CDs with my friends putting songs from all genres together in one place,” tells David. “As different as they all sounded individually—as a playlist there was cohesion. It became the soundtrack to my summer. Season. Life. That’s what I wanted this album to be. Rooted in my Appalachian roots and love for country music but daring to bring in different genres and sounds to give fans a wider scope of who I am and bring back some nostalgia at the same time.”</p><p>The album showcases Morris’s diverse range throughout the country and hip-hop realms. With his previous viral releases, “Carrying Your Love” and “Dutton Ranch Freestyle,” Morris lays the foundation for an impactful album that showcases his mark on the industry.</p><p>In 2020, Morris’ single “Carrying Your Love,” which samples the George Strait classic, went to the top of the charts peaking at No. 3 on Trending Sounds within TikTok. The song placed Morris at No.12 on the Billboard Emerging Chart, No.3 in digital sales country, and No.12 in all-genre sales. Following that single, Morris released “Dutton Ranch Freestyle,” which quickly gained viral success like his previous release. On October 19, “Dutton Ranch Freestyle” officially reached RIAA Gold Certification.</p><p><span><strong><span>Bored In The USA Tracklisting</span></strong></span><br>Prettiest Thing (David Morris, Brandon Manley)<br><strong>Bored In The USA (David Morris, Brandon Manley)</strong><br>Someday You Will (David Morris, Seth Alley)<br><strong>I Hate This Job (David Morris, Noah West, Jared Griffin)</strong><br>He Ain’t Me (David Morris, Brandon Manley)<br><strong>Dutton Ranch Freestyle (David Morris, Brandon Manley)</strong><br>She’s With Me Now (David Morris, Jake Rose)<br><strong>You Deserve Better (David Morris, Robert Deahl)</strong><br>Proud Of You (David Morris, Brandon Manley)<br><strong>Carrying Your Love (David Morris, Jeff Stevens, Steve Bogard, Robert Deahl, Nikolas Grivellas)</strong><br>American Idle (David Morris, Suli, Slimmy Beats)<br><strong>Stupid (David Morris, Seth Alley)&nbsp;</strong><br>My Fault (David Morris, Christian Delapena, Máté Gere, Danny Davanzo)<br><strong>Hot Beer In Hell (David Morris)&nbsp;</strong><br>Stuck In My Hometown (David Morris, Robert Deahl, Nikolas Grivellas)</p><p>Described as a “country music genre-bender (All Country News),” the producer, singer, and songwriter is currently finishing out the year on the West Coast with his “Heartbreak Hometown” tour.
