As puberty sets in, most of us get lustful, and to be honest, having sexual feelings is quite normal. You may be wondering, “Why am I still horny after sex?” in fact. But keep in mind that it’s not the appropriate path to move forward to judge oneself.</p><p>There is no specific thing which can be included that governs to increase the feeling of sexual desire. Examples such as the feel of your partner hair against your skin and the scent of their cologne. Individual differences exist in sexual preferences and turn-ons. Your greatest buddy or perhaps even your lover might not have the same as yours what motivates you. All people have sexual cravings, however some more than others.</p><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=#>Sexual Stigma and its relation with Psychological Well-Being</a></strong></p><p>However, there may be a few reasons for your perceived increased inclination toward sexual activity or prolonged periods of stimulation. Your body naturally produces sexual desires. There are numerous biological, psychological, and social elements that might impact your sex drive. In general, having a constant want for sex is perfectly natural, but there are several situations where this urge may not go away.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Factors that may cause high libido</h4><p>Hormones, seeing an obscene scene on TV or other circumstances can all cause one to feel horny. Variations in progesterone and estrogen levels also affect<a href=#> sexual desire</a>.</p><h5 class=wp-block-heading>Hormones:</h5><p>Libido is significantly influenced by hormones. Testosterone surges may increase arousal. Similarly, testosterone levels are higher in those who participate in sexual activities. This sets up a vicious cycle that may eventually lead to an increase in sex urge. Although desire and testosterone are related, sexologist and naturopathic physician Jordin Wiggins, N.D., claims the relationship is more complex than that. Libido is also impacted by progesterone and estrogen. “Estrogen is more clearly linked with physiological arousal (blood flow to the genitals, vaginal lubrication),” says mbg’s licensed relationship and sex therapist Indigo Stray Conger, LMFT, CST.</p><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=#>The Depathologization of Homosexuality</a></strong></p><p>In addition, Wiggins thinks it is critical to consider neurotransmitters like dopamine and oxytocin that are linked to pleasure, connection, and arousal. During the height of romance, these hormones tend to flare up, which is why libido can seem higher at the beginning of a new relationship.</p><h5 class=wp-block-heading>Hypersexuality:</h5><p>Healthcare professionals vigorously dispute the problem of hypersexuality. Everybody has a different sex drive.<br>However, it’s worthwhile to investigate if your sexual cravings are making you uncomfortable and are affecting your everyday activities, such as your capacity to be productive or build relationships.</p><h5 class=wp-block-heading>Aphrodisiac foods:</h5><p>A few foods have the power to raise arousal and give you a want for some time in between the sheets. Whether deliberately or not, you can be adding a little extra fuel to the engine if you’re stuffing these meals on your plate.</p><p>Osteopathic OB/GYN Anna Cabeca, D.O. claims that phenylethylamine6 (PEA) is a chemical found in both chocolate and cheese. According to her, the material is a “natural amphetamine produced by the brain in response to the feeling of love.” “And PEA is believed to be responsible for that hormonal rush during sex.”Although the effectiveness of aphrodisiacs in boosting libido remains unclear, several common aphrodisiacs, such as avocados, oysters, and omega-3 fats, do include vitamins and minerals that support general health, including hormone health and consequently sexual health.</p><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=#>Sexual Performance Anxiety: Symptoms, Causes, and Treatment</a></strong></p><h5 class=wp-block-heading>Frequent Masturbation:</h5><p>Regularly masturbating can boost desire in two ways: directly and indirectly. “When we ignore our body’s drive and arousal cues for too long through distraction, stress, or lack of a partner, those cues begin to go dormant,” Stray Conger says.</p><p>Therefore, the more sexual activity—including masturbation—a person partakes in, the easier it is for them to become physiologically aroused.</p><p>Wiggins states more plainly, “It can also increase the release of hormones, like dopamine and testosterone.” Furthermore, although masturbation is typically a solitary activity, it can also enhance pleasure when done with a companion.</p><p>“Individuals who masturbate often know what they like and how to communicate it to their partner so, therefore, report greater satisfaction in relationships and better intimacy and sexual communication,” Wiggins states.</p><h5 class=wp-block-heading>Menstruation:</h5><p>Some people may experience an increase in sex drive during their menstrual cycle and truly like having sex during that time. Due to an increase in estrogen and testosterone during the menstrual cycle, you are often a little more sexually active than usual. The medical director of Tampa Obstetrics and ob/gyn Jill Hechtman, M.D., previously discussed having sex while on your period.</p><h5 class=wp-block-heading>Alcohol:</h5><p>Drinking alcohol can affect a person’s sexual life in a good or bad way. Dr. Ross says that having a moderate amount of alcohol might give you “liquid courage,” which increases confidence, reduces inhibition, and puts you in a sexual mood. But binge drinking too much might have a bad influence on one’s libido and make it harder to reach an orgasm. As a matter of fact, a 2016 study affirms that individuals assigned male at birth who consume alcohol frequently experience sexual difficulties, such as erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation.</p><p>Overall, according to Dr. Ross, drinking alcohol to raise libido “is not a healthy approach to boosting sexual function,” even though it occasionally may increase sex drive.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>What to do to lower your libido</h4><p>Lehmiller suggests that the first thing to consider if you’re seeking strategies to reduce your desire is “Why?” “Is the issue of unresolved shame or the social comparison [you’re] making, or is high libido itself really a problem?” he asks. People frequently feel ashamed of having sex. Either your libido is too high because you’re comparing it to someone with a low libido, or a spouse or friend may have told you that you desire “too much” sex. Howard advises identifying the aspects of your libido that irritate you and concentrating on those rather than your desire itself. According to her, “people who experience symptoms of anxiety, other mental stressors, and/or engage in unsafe sexual practices, often seek to lower their libido because they have increased sexual desire.”</p><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=#>Asexuality as a Sexual Orientation</a></strong></p><p>Seeking a sex therapist can help you determine whether there is indeed an issue with your libido, identify potential causes, and devise a solution if your excessive desire is upsetting you or making daily life more challenging.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>How to handle constantly feeling horny</h4><h5 class=wp-block-heading>Meditation:</h5><p>There are several benefits to meditation. For example, it can aid with tension and anxiety. These days, mindfulness meditation can improve your sexual life. However, it’s also a means of getting over being aroused.</p><h5 class=wp-block-heading>Exercise:</h5><p>You can feel less physically lustful by exercising since it helps your blood flow back into your body and away from your genitalia. Numerous individuals claim that working out or even merely tensing up their muscles helps get rid of bothersome thoughts.</p><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=#>Freud’s Stages of Psychosexual Development</a></strong></p><h5 class=wp-block-heading>Cold-shower:</h5><p>This is more of a temporary solution for when your lust takes over at home and you’re attempting to control it by not masturbating. Then consider having a cold shower to help you de-stress, move your body, and get rid of that feeling.</p><h5 class=wp-block-heading>Seek a Therapist:</h5><p>If you have a medical condition, a doctor might be your best bet; otherwise, a therapist might be a wonderful option to help you modify the way you think about sex, sexual impulses, and horniness.</p>Reference+<ul><li>Https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/why-am-i-hornier-at-certain-times-of-the-month#when-does-it-happen</li><li>Https://www-healthshots-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/www.healthshots.com/</li><li>Https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/why-am-i-so-horny</li><li>Https://www.prevention.com/sex</li><li>Healthline.com</li></ul><span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Awareness</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Rising Back after SetBacks in Life</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>May 1, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Awareness</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Understanding correlation between attachment styles and life satisfaction:</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>April 30, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Awareness</a>, <a href=# rel="category tag">Education</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Navigating Life’s Transitions: Academics and Beyond</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>April 30, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Awareness</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Psychology behind Savings</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>April 29, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Awareness</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>What is Languishing?</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>April 29, 2024<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sb%2FYnJ%2BopJ%2BcwG%2BvzqZmn52Vobavs4yhpqumqWKurbiMrZ%2BeZaSeuqZ51qGYrWWRp7JuwMeeZKmrqZi1sLjOoKCcmZxiv6at0qilrGWSmrWqusNmoK1n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
