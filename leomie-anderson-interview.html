The business owner, who launched her own fashion brand, Lapp – specialising in active and loungewear – four years ago, believes that we've turned a corner in terms of dress codes and have proven that we don’t need to be following a strict set of rules and restrictions that are rooted in the past.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I feel that society is now realising that you don’t need to be wearing a suit to look professional; you don’t need to have on this protective armour for people to take you seriously,” she tells me. “I can run a whole business via Zoom and Whatsapp, so why do I need to dress a certain way to do that? Why do I need to dress in something that doesn’t make me feel like myself? I don’t want to go back to putting on a shirt or a tight, uncomfortable dress just to be taken seriously. That doesn’t make you professional; it shouldn’t be about that, it should be about what you have to say.”</p><img alt="leomie anderson with jourdan dunn" title="leomie anderson with jourdan dunn" width=5915 height=4436 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/flannels-x-lapp-jourdan-dunn-1-1615281818.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Flannels</span><p>Leomie Anderson with Jourdan Dunn</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This is a huge part of the reason that Anderson launched Lapp. Inspired by her own experience, where she felt she could get the most done and be the best version of herself wearing something comfortable, she decided that she wanted to encourage others to discover the same.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>I can run a business via Zoom and Whatsapp, so why do I need to dress a certain way to do that?<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Lapp is all about empowering female voices – it's about making women feel strong and that their voice should be heard,” she explains. “Lapp is about making women feel like the best version of themselves.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This doesn’t come across just with the retail side of the business, where Anderson favours bold colours and designs which accentuate the female form – “Every piece is about highlighting and celebrating the female body, whatever shape you are” – but also in the content Lapp produces, including an online magazine, which focuses on female issues.</p><img alt="leomie anderson with neelam gill" title="leomie anderson with neelam gill" width=5528 height=4146 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/flannels-x-lapp-neelam-gill-4-1615281870.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Flannels</span><p>Leomie Anderson with Neelam Gill</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“With the blog, it's not about money – it doesn’t make any money. It is not about that. People often think that when you have a brand, you should be completely focused on the financial aspect, but to me, it’s about these moments when a young girl reaches out to me and tells me that the platform has really spoken to her – that is what makes me feel really proud.”</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Every piece is about highlighting and celebrating the female body, whatever shape you are<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Anderson says that she wanted the clothing label to represent and project this same feeling – and one moment early on sent that message across better than she could ever have imagined.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“A monumental point for me was when Rihanna wore Lapp to the women’s march. It was not just because it was Rihanna, but it was also the specific moment that she chose to wear it for. It was really huge and iconic for the brand and it just completely embodied the message of what I was trying to do. It put Lapp on the map as a brand for women, by women – and that is exactly what I wanted the brand to be about from the beginning.”</p><img alt="leomie anderson with munroe berdof" title="leomie anderson with munroe berdof" width=4826 height=3620 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/flannels-x-lapp-munroe-bergdorf-1-1615281940.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Flannels</span><p>Leomie Anderson with Munroe Berdof</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Not only did this help to gain the best possible type of exposure for Lapp, but it also gave Anderson a little bit more confidence: “It really helped to shape the brand early on. It pushed me to keep going with it.”</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>I think I have encountered every single obstacle possible when it comes to running a business<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Despite these brilliant moments though, running a business is far from easy, which Anderson is quick to admit. When I ask what some of the biggest lessons she’s learnt along the way are, she replies: “Have you got all day?”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I think I have encountered every single obstacle possible when it comes to running a business. It is just me and two freelancers, so I have to do pretty much every aspect of it. In the early stages, it’s very easy to just want to do the fun stuff – you want to do the design, you want to do the shoots, you want to hear people tell you how amazing the pieces are, but the bottom line is that even if you do all of that right, if the business side of things is not handled and managed properly, then it doesn’t matter how good your designs are.”</p><img alt="leomie anderson with ms banks" title="leomie anderson with ms banks" width=4770 height=3577 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/flannels-x-lapp-ms-banks-2-1615281987.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Flannels</span><p>Leomie Anderson with Ms Banks</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“At the same time, the business side of things is not something that you can just hand over to someone else,” she adds. “You really have to build a lot of trust to do this and not everyone has the best intentions. That is something that I learnt the hard way really early on – and I am still learning to this day. You have to be careful who you trust because no one is going to fight harder for your brand than you.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">That being said, Anderson’s latest project came about because she found a group of people who understood her message and were willing to go the extra mile to make it work.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“This partnership came at a time when I was really unsure who to trust and who had genuine interest in the brand doing well, but once I sat around the table with these women and saw how much they believed in the vision and believed in the brand, it really just made me want to work with them and make this the best capsule ever.”</p><img alt="leomie anderson with neelam gill" title="leomie anderson with neelam gill" width=4904 height=3678 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/flannels-x-lapp-neelam-gill-2-1615282036.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Flannels</span><p>Leomie Anderson with Neelam Gill</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The collaboration is a 23-piece collection with luxury retailer Flannels, which launches this week in celebration of International Women’s Day and, like all of Lapp’s collections, is made up of seamless sportswear in a wide range of sizes, helping to make activewear more inclusive. The two brands have worked closely together for over six months to develop and produce the collection, which saw Flannels keen to embrace Anderson’s passion for social activism and feminism.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“The label powerfully showcases where the foundations of the brand stemmed from, raising awareness for the need to diversify the fashion landscape across numerous avenues, through the shapes, sizes and styles they are offering,” Emma iLori, Flannels’ head of womenswear elevation says.</p><img alt="leomie anderson with jourdan dunn" title="leomie anderson with jourdan dunn" width=5489 height=4117 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/flannels-x-lapp-jourdan-dunn-2-1615282078.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Flannels</span><p>Leomie Anderson with Jourdan Dunn</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Anderson is not only working to empower women’s voices, but is also fighting for more diversity in the industry, something which she feels has only been dealt with on a level that is “very surface” so far, despite big claims made by brands last summer.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>I am usually the only Black person on set<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Look, doing a campaign with more racial diversity is great – and when I was growing up, I wish there had been more representation in fashion imagery, so of course I am happy about that, but I am still usually the only Black person on set. If they tell me that the CEO is going to stop by the shoot, I know that is not going to be a Black person. For me now, if businesses want to make real progress and tangible change, they need to look within and see how the structure of their company may be upholding the oppression of Black people and systemic racism.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“It’s all good putting me as a Black girl as the face of your brand, but how many people at your company are Black? How many credits are there going to be for a Black photographer, a Black make-up artist or a Black stylist?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“This is a very big part of the problem. As long as we stay satisfied with them putting a Black girl in the campaign, then nothing is ever going to change.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.flannels.com/women/brands/lapp-the-brand data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Lapp's capsule collection is available to shop on Flannels now." data-vars-ga-product-id=3209e96c-cf6a-4c63-9953-ba0a676c4518 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.flannels.com/women/brands/lapp-the-brand data-product-url=https://www.flannels.com/women/brands/lapp-the-brand data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X618962&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.flannels.com%2Fwomen%2Fbrands%2Flapp-the-brand" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=a4a8a3bb-a245-44f3-94a6-b7b718661ece class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Lapp's capsule collection is available to shop on Flannels now.</a></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In need of some at-home inspiration? <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://hearst.emsecure.net/optiext/cr.aspx?ID=szpklLhpWonj6JnlBH3GzpALHvm1ZwMa0oU9UEP6sYg4RDPmqEfyeN1vIR80j83YlJMODbnaXySUsa" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sign up to our free weekly newsletter" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Sign up to our free weekly newsletter</a> for skincare and self-care, the latest cultural hits to read and download, and the little luxuries that make staying in so much more satisfying.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://hearst.emsecure.net/optiext/cr.aspx?ID=szpklLhpWonj6JnlBH3GzpALHvm1ZwMa0oU9UEP6sYg4RDPmqEfyeN1vIR80j83YlJMODbnaXySUsa" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="SIGN UP" rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink class="body-btn-link css-lihu0l emevuu60"><strong>SIGN UP</strong></a></p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwssCsn6KnnmSudIGWcG5qcWJkuaa7zKKcZpmembKzv86nZKKmpJq%2Ft7XEsGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
