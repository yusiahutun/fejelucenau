Japanese Wagyu is graded by highly trained independent assessors using the Beef Marbling Scale (BMS). Scores between one and 12 rate the amount and quality of marbling, with 12 the highest degree. More commonly seen on restaurant menus are “A” ratings between one to five, or “M” ratings up to nine. In both cases a higher number denotes superior quality; both A5 and M9 are equivalent to a BMS of 8-12."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

This can range from free-range grazing, noise monitoring and tailored diets, through to more unusual luxuries, such as massaging the animal, or the additions of red wine or beer to feed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/10/12/4da0242a-17c5-4d5d-b27e-c45259db3182_c9d39b69.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">AP Place Hong Kong Co Limited, the parent group of Japanese restaurant Ushidoki, sources Wagyu from a farm with a reputation for providing cows with five-star treatment is. “Our Odagyu Wagyu comes from the Oda Chikusan ranch in Kagoshima,” said managing director Masashi Kamatani.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">The secret to a succulent steak tartare – according to top Hong Kong chefs</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The cows’ ‘accommodation’ for two years is luxurious, lofty, well-ventilated barns laid with fir and cypress mats, and they are served a specially designed feed of 12 ingredients rich in rice and barley. This rearing ensures healthy bones and fine meat, with outstanding marbling and a low-fat melting point for melt-in-the-mouth consistency.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/10/12/1c3e9bf4-bbdb-45b7-9037-3c499a628aff_2c7c5d71.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Wagyu cattle are raised carefully with the utmost care, with farmers taking extra measures towards their well-being, which affects the quality and flavour. You really can taste the difference,” said Dickson Wong, head chef at Feather & Bone Wan Chai.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As well as serving Wagyu to diners, the restaurant stocks cuts to take home at its butcher’s counter, imported directly from farms in Australia and Japan. “From Australia we import Oakey Wagyu from Tasmania, partly due to the way the animals are raised and partly due to its proven lineage, ensuring a top quality product with guaranteed marbling characteristics,” added Wong. “From Japan we stock Japanese Miyazaki Wagyu, which has a buttery texture, a dense beefy flavour and is beautiful, even marbling. It’s of exceptional quality.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/10/12/e85600ac-d4a3-4817-ae2e-d6b4c7ae72b1_c9d39b69.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">If regular Wagyu just isn’t enough, further enhancement is achieved by ageing, which can even include snow ageing. Bifteck, which only offers Japanese Wagyu, serves A5 snow-aged Wagyu beef from Niigata.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Kwok said, “The beef is snow-aged by an ancient yukimuro ageing technique at an icy 1-2 degrees Celsius, with high humidity of around 90 per cent. The meat is exceptionally tender and the process brings out a delicious sweetness and a mellow and rich melt-in-the-mouth taste.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">What is mapo tofu and where did it get its ugly name?</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Accounting for Wagyu’s popularity, Wong suggested, “Firstly, there’s its flavour, with salty, sweet, sour and bitter notes all at once. The marbling also helps in producing umami-like flavours. The texture is also finer, resulting in a more flavoursome experience.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/10/12/82cdfd1b-6aaf-45c7-89cd-4cde05c5f4e5_4ca824ac.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Similar sentiments are shared by Roberto Zorzoli, executive chef at Lan Kwai Fong’s Porterhouse Seafood & Steak: “Wagyu beef is popular worldwide because of its superior eating quality compared with other cattle breeds. Also part of the appeal is its delicate texture and beautiful marbling, resulting in a more flavourful eating experience.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Evidence of its popularity can be found on the restaurant’s menu, with over half of the beef options being Wagyu sourced from Japan, Australia and New Zealand. “We select the Wagyu cuts we serve based on the beef marbling score and, of course, the farm itself. We like to ensure that our Wagyu steaks can be traced directly back to the farm, which ensures quality,” said Zorzoli.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/10/12/1a8eb2c8-6aa5-4c32-9773-02bb3bf475b4_58dda525.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In addition to the taste, marbling and tenderness, Kamatani believes Hongkongers are fond of Wagyu due to an overall appreciation of Japanese cuisine.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“At Ushidoki, Wagyu is the star. Nine of the 11 dishes on our tongue-to-tail kaiseki menu feature the breed,” he said. “Wagyu is well-loved in Hong Kong because of people’s generous admiration for Japanese cuisine, as well as the superior eating quality compared to other cattle breeds.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Where to eat in Hong Kong in October – from Ozakaya to Oktoberfest</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For Wong, there is also a certain status element involved. “I believe many associate Wagyu with quality and therefore people choose this over other beef, aware of what they get for their money,” he added.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“People like to impress at times, so we often see people buy Wagyu for home entertaining.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/10/12/f9ddfd98-7408-4f80-b907-480f766ee040_4f85718b.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Wong’s pro tips for those wanting to serve Wagyu at their next dinner party are to choose a thicker cut, ensure the beef is at room temperature before cooking, and follow the following cooking procedure: “Season with quality salt and pepper. The pan must be scorching hot – sear both sides on high. Remove and rest covered for about two minutes. Return to the hot pan, add a knob of butter, garlic and thyme, baste with the juices and then remove. Rest again and it will be a perfect medium-rare.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For those who prefer a professional do the cooking, there are a plethora of restaurants in Hong Kong serving Wagyu in cuts of all shapes and sizes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And this is one trend that is clearly here to stay, with Hongkongers’ appetites for the king of beef showing no sign of abating.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZMC1xcueZqWdmajCs7GOmqmtoZOhsnB%2FkHJsb25mZL%2BwuMusZKunqZiybq7Enp1mr5iueritxrKsZqufYr2wvNSlmKtllai9pq%2FImqOlsV2dvK%2BzjKSmp58%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
