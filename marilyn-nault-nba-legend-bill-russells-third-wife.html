She is the daughter of Quentin and Helen Nault and has four brothers; Phil, Eric, James, and Kyle. Growing up she was surrounded by her siblings as they were all brought up together in one household.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Bill-Russell-wife_jeanine.jpg><p>The loss of her father in 1987 was a great tragedy for the family, as he had owned a jewelry store in Kansas. Even more sadly, one of her brothers passed away several years after her death in 2020.</p><p>Nault was brought up in a devoutly religious family, with her parents adhering to the Catholic belief system. She went to a Catholic high school located in Kansas and decided against pursuing higher education, instead opting for employment after graduating from high school.</p><h2><b>Career</b></h2><p>After completing her high school education, Nault relocated to Seattle and followed in her father’s footsteps by taking a job as a jewelry salesperson. It was through this position that she met the love of her life, Bill Russell; they first crossed paths at one of the jewelry stores where Nault worked in the city.</p><p>Nault had a multifaceted professional career prior to her relationship with Bill Russell; she worked as a jewelry salesperson and also served as his secretary, providing assistance in accounting. After they began dating and eventually married, Nault decided to focus solely on being a housewife instead of continuing her work outside the home.</p><h2><strong>Marilyn Nault’s Marriage</strong></h2><p>Marilyn and William Felton Russell first crossed paths at a jewelry store where Marilyn was employed. Despite the immediate connection, their relationship did not take off right away; instead, they cultivated a strong friendship over several years before eventually tying the knot. William is renowned for his two-decade-long career with the Boston Celtics in the NBA as an outstanding basketball player.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Marilyn-Nault-and-NBA-Legend-Bill-Russell.webp><p>After Bill’s remarriage, he and Nault developed a close bond as she assisted him with various tasks. Her impressive skill at dominoes further drew them together, and eventually, their relationship grew into something more. In 1996 they tied the knot, cementing their newfound romance.</p><p>Marilyn Nault and Bill Russell enjoyed a private marriage, rarely participating in public events. When they did appear together, it was usually at basketball games or dinner engagements. Despite their preference for privacy, the couple still managed to travel extensively around the world during their time together.</p><p>Russell and Nault enjoyed a blissful life together, as described by their daughter Karen. The couple had an incredibly strong bond and demonstrated their commitment to each other through Russell’s promise to make Nault laugh every day. Unfortunately, after just over 10 years of marriage, the relationship was tragically cut short when Nault passed away in 2009.</p><h2><strong>Children</strong></h2><p>Nault and Bill Russell did not have any biological children together, however, Nault was a stepmother to the three children from Russell’s first marriage; Karen Kenyatta Russell, William Jr., and Jacob. She provided them with love and support as if they were her own.</p><p>Bill Russell married Jeanine Russel sometime around 2018, following the death of his third wife, Marilyn Nault. This was his fourth marriage and lasted until he passed away in 2022. Prior to this union with Jeanine and Marilyn Nault, Bill had two other wives.</p><p>Russell’s first marriage was to Rose Swisher, his college sweetheart, in 1956. However, the relationship gradually deteriorated over time and they divorced in 1973. Afterward, Russell married former model Dorothy Anstett in 1977; unfortunately, this union also did not last long and ended with a divorce three years later in 1980.</p><h2><strong>Marilyn Nault’s Net worth and Earnings</strong></h2><p>Bill Russell’s wife was a very private person, and there is not much information available about her. After getting married to the wealthy basketball player, she quit her job and enjoyed the luxury of living off her estimated $10 million net worth at her death.</p><h2><strong>What was Marilyn Nault’s cause of death?</strong></h2><p>The cause of her death was not initially disclosed, leading to surprise and shock as her passing seemed sudden. It later became known that she had been suffering from cancer for some time before finally succumbing to the illness.</p><p>Nault was sadly taken from us at the age of 59. A private funeral service was held in her honor in Seattle, and she was laid to rest at Lake View Cemetery located in Seattle, Washington, U.S.A.. Our thoughts are with those who were close to her during this difficult time.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a class=row-title href=# aria-label="“Who is Parker Leverett and Where is He Today?” (Edit)">Who is Parker Leverett and Where is He Today?</a></strong></p><h2><strong>Who was Bill Russell married to before Marilyn Nault?</strong></h2><p>Bill Russell was previously wed to Rose Swisher on December 9th, 1956.
