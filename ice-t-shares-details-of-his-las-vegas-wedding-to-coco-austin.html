When they went to get a license, the clerk in Vegas thought they were already hitched, adding an element of confusion. Still, she agreed to help out, with a condition.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“She’s like, ‘Y’all getting no license unless you take a picture with me,’ ” he said. “So, I had to take a picture with all the girls there and we came out and there’s a limo outside. They really want to get you married. You know, short and sweet across the street.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ice-t-coco-vegas-wedding-details.EMBED_.jpg><p data-skm-boomerang-el-9=processed>He explained, “But I said, ‘We’re not just doing it in any chapel.’ So, we went back to Caesar’s Palace, where we were staying. It was New Year’s Eve and I said, ‘We got to get married tonight.'”</p><p data-skm-boomerang-el-9=processed>He recalls almost hitting a brick wall when the iconic hotel’s chapel said they were closed — but a little name dropping fixed the situation immediately. &nbsp;“He’s like, ‘We’re closed for the night,'” the rapper remembers. “I never say my name but I said, ‘It’s Ice-T.’ He said, ‘Bulls***.’ So, I went down to the elevator to the fifth floor and walked in. The guy was like, ‘No f****** way.'”</p><p data-skm-boomerang-el-9=processed>It goes without saying that the chapel stayed open for the star-studded nuptials. And when <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the couple</a> went down in the elevator, with the blonde bombshell dressed up and ready to go, he says some young fans were impressed. “Coco had the bouquet in her hands. The kids were like, ‘Ice-T, yo! Y’all just got married?'”</p><p data-skm-boomerang-el-9=processed>So, he told the outlet, they had an elevator reception. “So, they <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>threw us a reception</a> in the elevator,” he divulged. “They were partying and blowing horns and s***.”</p><p data-skm-boomerang-el-9=processed>With the formalities out of the way, the rapper, now 65, says they went out to celebrate the New Year. “We never really told anybody about this because everyone thought we <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>were already married,</a>” he shared. “So, we never did a true celebration.” Still, they wound up renewing their vows in front of the world. “We did it in 10 years on&nbsp;Ice Loves Coco,” he said. “We had a big thing in L.A. and it was better, because we had been married 10 years.”</p><p data-skm-boomerang-el-9=processed>Ice-T and<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Coco share daughter</a> <strong>Chanel</strong>, now 7 years old. For the uninitiated, they’re regularly criticized for their <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>unconventional parenting methods</a> with their little girl, including <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>extended co-sleeping</a> and extended breast feeding.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH16e5BuZqKblWLBbr%2FHmqmeq12ZsrWtyKWqZqeWYrWqv4ylmKxlppq0or%2BMsJydnJmjtG7AzmaaqJufYq62v9OipWg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
