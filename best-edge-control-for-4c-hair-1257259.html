After hours of research, I am being loud, and straight — edge controls are no less than a magical elixir! They offer extra hold and control to your flyaways and baby hair, and help you style your hair effortlessly. Secondly, they are long-lasting, non-greasy, and perfect for attaining a polished and sleek look. In addition, they are great for braids, locs, and dry, as well as coarse hair.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Our contributor Priyanka Swami, Founder and CEO of Perfect Locks Hair Company, a prominent human hair extensions brand, says, “Edge controls for 4C stand out from the rest by offering a firm grip without any flaking or build-up. They're designed to moisturize and nourish your hair, keeping it from drying out and breaking at the edges. Edge controls for 4C also often contain ingredients that help protect your hair from environmental irritants and heat styling. If you're looking for an edge control for your 4C hair, choose one free of harsh chemicals like sulfate, parabens, and mineral oils. You want to find a formula that gives you a strong hold while providing nourishing care for your gorgeous curls.”</p><p>Let me tell you that after splurging on the strongest edge control, you will never ponder for anything else.

Now let me run you through a detailed buying guide.</p><p><h2 class=title>How to Choose the Best Edge Control for 4C Hair?</h2></p><p>Here are a few aspects that I should consider before splurging on a good edge control -</p><p><strong>Ingredients</strong>: Make sure you pay heed to the list of ingredients before getting your hands on a good edge control for 4C hair. Adding more to the same, our contributor Priyanka Swami says, “The best edge controls for 4C hair are usually made with natural moisturizers and nourishing ingredients. Look for products containing ingredients like shea butter, castor oil, aloe vera, argan oil, jojoba oil, etc. These ingredients provide hydration, stimulate hair growth, and hold moisture without leaving greasy residue.”</p><p>It is also considered wise to splurge on edge controls that are enriched with the goodness of passion fruit seed oil, apple cider vinegar, flaxseed oil, sweet almond oil, wheat protein, and other hair-nourishing ingredients. Speaking about my favorite edge control, I am quite impressed with ORS Olive Oil Edge Control Hair Gel and its splendid formulation.</p><p><strong>Hair Type</strong>: Ensure that you analyze your hair type before investing in the best edge control 4C hair. There are too many fishes in the pond but pick the one that suits your hair type the best. You will find ones suitable for all hair textures and types, whereas some are strictly meant for dry, frizzy, thick, thin, or coarse hair type. Do not invest in an edge control that is not meant for your hair type.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Consistency And Texture</strong>: Always inspect the consistency or texture of the hair gel for edges that you are planning to buy. I personally recommend edge controls that possess a smooth and easy-to-glide gel-like texture promising extra hold and control just like Dola Hair Edge Control.</p><p><strong>Formula</strong>: The next important aspect to consider is the formula of the best edge control for 4C hair that you are thinking of snagging. Ensure that the edge control is free from parabens, phthalates, silicones, mineral oils, synthetic fragrances, and other harsh toxins. I advise you to pick those that are vegan and cruelty-free.</p><p><strong>Contributor:&nbsp;</strong>Priyanka Swamy, CEO and Founder of <a href=#>Perfect Locks Hair Company</a></p><p>Conclusion</p><p>That was all about the best edge controls for 4C hair that you should think of snagging right away.
