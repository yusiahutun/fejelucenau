That’s what it wants to do. So why not let it?’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/01/07/3217e772-2de3-11ea-8334-1a17c6a14ef4_972x_131842.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The design duo, known for the pristine precision of the dinnerware and ceramic lighting sold under their retail brand, relished the technical challenge of letting glaze run amok – normally a costly frustration – and soon hit upon their signature technique for this series. By placing a vase upside down in a bed of sand, once a volume of glaze is applied and fired, it runs down the surface and disappears into the sand, where it eventually solidifies into an intricate lattice fanning out from the vase’s midsection.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“From there, it’s all about playing with the temperatures and chemistry of the glaze, to orchestrate it and get it to dance and to build,” McLin says. “The whole creative process is thinking upside down and looking at the path the glaze will take and where we need to position the sand.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“But the best part is when it comes out of the kiln,” Progin adds. “You’re there like an archaeologist with a brush to brush the sand away and discover what’s there.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The first iterations capturing this movement of glaze – thin and lacy protuberances resembling Elizabethan collars – were much too delicate. More recent versions, however, such as their Deshabille series, have proved surprisingly robust and have survived multiple freight journeys to and from exhibitions in South Korea and mainland China.</p>“Before, we were thinking of [the glaze] more as clothing,” Progin says. “But as they became more refined they became more like poetic landscapes, so we started researching traditional <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Chinese ink paintings</span></a> and representations of landscapes, looking for a way to interpret that into 3D.”<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/01/07/a9f99522-2de5-11ea-8334-1a17c6a14ef4_972x_131842.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The current exhibition series, entitled “Without Leaving the Room”, arose from this research, with the deep indigo pigment evident throughout referencing traditional ink paintings and evoking mountain scenes after dusk.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chinese history has been an endless source of fascination and inspiration for both McLin, who is from California in the US, and Swiss national Progin, who was born and raised in Hong Kong. Since coming to Hong Kong together in 2008 from New York and creating their company (the 22N in the name references the latitude of Hong Kong, 22 degrees north), the couple have also set up a permanent studio in the ancient porcelain capital of Jingdezhen in mainland China’s Jiangxi province, where they hold extended residencies throughout the year.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While related to their commercially successful retail products, the couple’s exhibition works are a distinctly thoughtful, meticulously researched offshoot, aiming to document socio-economic changes and provoke discussion, with many projects designed to engage with local communities.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">It could be better organised right now but nothing is wasted. Everything we do finds its way into our work in the endJulie Progin on the pair’s growing “library of mistakes”</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Their four Fragments series, colourful precursors to their current exhibit, and Terra Mobiles, an otherworldly collection of outdoor sculptural furniture, have both earned international recognition, with the latter to feature at the Milan Furniture Fair in April this year.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In using baijiu liquor bottles as the base forms of the exhibition, Progin and McLin chose an ancient form that was in continuous production for thousands of years in Jingdezhen but has all but died out in the past decade – along with large painted tiles set in rosewood and translucent eggshell-thin porcelain, both once highly prized products of Jingdezhen.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“There are lots of people who have the skills to make these traditional crafts but there’s no demand for them now,” McLin says. “So we’re documenting that through our work – the evolution of the city and what has been abandoned.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/01/07/0e185f8a-2de5-11ea-8334-1a17c6a14ef4_972x_131842.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">That is not to say that the economy is not thriving in Jingdezhen. McLin describes, for example, the craftsman the couple hired to make their first line of Song dynasty-inspired dinnerware. With just two employees, he used to work out of his living room. Eight years on, the man has three factories, hundreds of employees and makes teapots for Starbucks.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The pair credit contrasting educational backgrounds for their complementary approaches to design. McLin studied fine arts and ceramics in “a more conceptual and non-functional direction”, while Progin specialised in textiles and industrial and product design, gaining experience in graphic design along the way.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“When we started off, I never thought we’d do anything like Latitude[22N]. I never thought I’d do anything functional,” McLin says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“And I never expected to design anything non-functional,” Progin says. “But now we both do both.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/01/07/42c01fb2-2de4-11ea-8334-1a17c6a14ef4_972x_131842.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This duality, epitomised by their two distinct labels, runs through most of the couple’s more conceptual work: archetypal forms cast from industrial production moulds, half glazed to perfection and half something that has run away with a life of its own.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As for the growing “library of mistakes”, Progin is unperturbed.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It could be better organised right now but nothing is wasted. Everything we do finds its way into our work in the end.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Refined Touch: Crossover Between Design and Craft, the exhibition at Design Spectrum, 7 Mallory Street, Wan Chai, ends on January 19.</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: How a mistake inspired a unique series of ceramics</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLavwMSroKiqo2K5qsLIp55omaKptqS4xGhqaWxkboF2e8eormalmajBorfEZpmem5Gism61zaynoqqRqbawuoyupaKppZp6pLHRmqSim6NiwKa%2ByJ6q</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
