But in Boston, I would end up going right back home, because it was really overstimulating,” she continued.</p><p>The 26-year-old said she wouldn’t hang out at a bar after with her co-stars as she ‘thought she could ruin everyone’s night’.</p><p>Despite being so famous worldwide, there is one thing Zendaya chooses to protect, her relationship with Tom Holland.</p><p>The two keep their <a href=#>celebrity</a> relationship very private, rarely speaking about the ins and outs, as the Euphoria star revealed she has control over what she ‘chooses to share’.</p><p>“Parts of my life, I accept, are going to be public. I can’t not be a person and live my life and love the person I love. But also, I do have control over what I choose to share,” the <a href=#>Hollywood</a> star revealed.</p><p>It’s about protecting the peace and letting things be your own but also not being afraid to exist. You can’t hide. That’s not fun, either. I am navigating it more than ever now,” she told Elle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/08/GettyImages-1440330464-683x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-zendaya-and-tom-holland-s-relationship-explored>Zendaya and Tom Holland’s relationship explored</h2><p>The two met while working together on Spider-Man: Homecoming in 2016, and the romance rumors shortly followed.</p><p>After years of rumors, the relationship was confirmed in 2021, when they were spotted sharing a kiss in the car by paparazzi.</p><p>Since then the two have been going strong, even appearing together at red carpets, although, as Zendaya mentioned, they do try and keep their romance as private as possible.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlwX2eAcMbEp5uasZFiuK%2Bx1maroZ1doryusc2tZKWhlpp6pLTAp56enF2strW0jJ%2BYpp1dl8K1edOhnKudo2K8r7GMrZ%2BippdiwKmxjKmpqKyVmMG0ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
