But the stories were still pretty great.</p><p>First, he asked her to describe the craziest moment she's had filming a love scene.</p><p>"Oh my goodness, well, what happened was," Perez began. "We were in the bed and I was supposed to get up but he was in the bed naked. And when I got up naked, and turned around, his penis wasn't there. "</p><p>"He had tucked his penis, but without telling me and I was like what the f--k?!" she exclaimed. "I'm standing there naked and these are real and they were kind of [motions swinging breasts] and he goes, 'What?!' and I go, 'Nothin'!' and we had to keep going."</p><p>"What happened was, he was afraid his penis was too small and he didn't want anyone to see his penis," she added.</p><p>Any guesses?</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:c2914c3d-c40d-5d07-87eb-be18387cb451 data-container-ref=toofab:article:0f1392e3-c974-561d-83f2-925ee05697e3 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/fe/5by4/2019/04/02/feca0a37f5b1500ea5727d3e50cd5d0f_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">ABC/Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">10 Juiciest Tidbits from Explosive 'View' Tell-All 'Ladies Who Punch'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Next, Cohen asked to reveal something she refused to do while filming a movie.</p><p>"It was during a fight scene and my costar, he said, 'Can I bite you in the tit during the fight?' and I said 'No," she said. "And he said, 'What about your ass?' and I said 'Okay.'"</p><p>Perez has talked about getting bit in the rear end while filming a fight scene for "Pineapple Express" in the past, naming the actor at the same -- could this be the same story? "<strong><a href=#>James Franco</a></strong> and I kind of threw away the choreography, too, and went for it," she told <strong><a href=#>CBS' Early Show</a></strong> in 2008. "He went for my butt, too! He bit my butt, which wasn't great and it didn't even make the movie and I am kind of pissed off about that."</p><p>Lastly, she was tasked with revealing the worst pickup line a male celebrity has ever used on her.</p><p>"Oh it's embarrassing. Gosh, if he's watching, he's gonna know," she said with a smile. "He said, 'You got a butt like a biscuit and I wanna pour gravy on it!"</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:2f6ea47e-04ee-5f65-bf91-9c6810b692c1 data-container-ref=toofab:article:0f1392e3-c974-561d-83f2-925ee05697e3 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/ab/5by4/2019/06/10/abd48b0d9bcf5c8fbaddf389e56571c6_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Bravo/Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Robin Givens Grilled About Ex Howard Stern's 'Small Penis' and That Mike Tyson-Brad Pitt Story</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlfnp7j29mamxfp7y0tcRmp56qla96uK3TnJ9mr5iWwW60wKmnnqajYrmqwsRmmaWhnpl6qsDEpqpo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
