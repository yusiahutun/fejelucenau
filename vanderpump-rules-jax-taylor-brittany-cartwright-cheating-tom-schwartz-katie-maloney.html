"I know what it's like to be in love with someone and be hurt, and you don't want to give up on a relationship that is special to you, but it's hard to come back from some of those things. I think Brittany is a really amazing girl, and for Jax to betray her just wasn't fair. She didn't deserve it."</p><p>"We've been through so much shit, though," Tom interrupted. "It'd be hypocritical for us to say that they should break up. After all the shit we went though, a lot of people said we should've broken up."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:a9a156c8-b6ed-579d-8b6a-4dae0e0d18fe data-container-ref=toofab:article:13dda2d9-5f58-5ae9-8494-399ae5cbf764 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/88/5by4/2017/12/12/883cedd1493d5859a653585cd1c327a4_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Bravo/Getty Composite</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">'Vanderpump Rules' Star Jax Taylor Confronted About Cheating on 'WWHL': 'I Deserve All This'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"Yeah, but I feel like what they went through was a little more damaging," Katie replied. "I think she should've made him work harder for it. We all know Jax, and if Jax thinks he can get away with something, he can get away with everything and anything. For me, it was just like, 'Oh, girl, I don't know that you want to set this precedent that you can let it go that quickly. If he thinks he's just gonna get a slap on the wrist, he'll probably do it again.'"</p><p>When Brittany <strong><a href=#>first approached Tom</a></strong> about the cheating at <strong><a href=#>Scheana Marie's</a></strong> masquerade party, Tom told her he didn't know about the cheating, and that even if he did, he wouldn't tell her about it.</p><p>"I'm an idiot. I'm a complete idiot," Tom said of his comments to Brittany. "I cannot believe that came out of my mouth. You know I'm a well-known Jax apologist, right? I'm his No. 1. fan."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:a9a156c8-b6ed-579d-8b6a-4dae0e0d18fe data-container-ref=toofab:article:13dda2d9-5f58-5ae9-8494-399ae5cbf764 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/88/5by4/2017/12/12/883cedd1493d5859a653585cd1c327a4_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Bravo/Getty Composite</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">'Vanderpump Rules' Star Jax Taylor Confronted About Cheating on 'WWHL': 'I Deserve All This'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"Maybe I'm naive, but I knew nothing of this," he added. "I was completely caught off guard. It was a shock to all of us.
