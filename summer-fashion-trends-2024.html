With mermaidcore, rosettes and shades of lavender dominating summer trends, you can see your favorite celebrities rock a trend before you decide if you want to yourself.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>As consumers, we subsequently work through the same tug-and-pull of trends that designers do but on the receiving end. Do we aim to be aspirational or <a href=# rel=noopener>affordable</a>? Do we shop for the moment? Exhilarating, though potentially fleeting. Or, do we shop for the future? Curated for forever, at the risk of playing it a bit safe. Spoiler alert: there’s no correct answer.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>To be hyper-aware of trends and the evolving landscape of your own closet is to be a conscious consumer. The current state of the trend cycle moves at a dizzying pace—getting swept up in the current feels inevitable. The art of fashion and <a href=# rel=noopener>building your personal style</a> forms when the wearer moves past consciously participating in trends and chooses to </span><i><span>selectively </span></i><span>participate. No designer includes every upcoming trend in their collections and frankly, neither should you.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>That being said, the <a href=# rel=noopener>fashion trends for 2023</a> are all over the board. From a continuation of rosette accessories and Y2K influence and an influx of too-sheer-for-work slip dresses to delicate dip-dye, the Spring/Summer ‘23 collections from New York Fashion Week create a “choose your own adventure” game plan. You can scroll through every trend, but only a special few will realistically </span>make it into your closet. I’ve directed the top eight trends from the runway to try this summer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/sheer.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=sheer-genius>Sheer Genius</h2><p class=has-text-align-center>Every so often, a trend from a singular show will spark a wave full of similar styles. In this case, the trend in question is sheer and the trendsetter is Fendi’s Fall/Winter 2022 collection. The Fendi collection debuted back in February but its influence was fully felt last week in New York City. It’s no longer taboo to have undergarments show through your frock—in fact, it’s preferred.&nbsp;Almost every major collection on the NYFW runways incorporated completely see-through garments. Tory Burch provided a masterclass in realistically wearable sheer with strategic layering while designers like Kim Shui took the opportunity to bare all.</p><p class=has-text-align-center>While many of the sheer pieces would be suitable for street style statements or a night in a dimly lit room, Jason Wu gave us multiple examples of sheer design in formal wear. The designer sent a strong variety of sheer gowns down the runway in floral, sparkly, lace and jewel tones (to name a few). In a backstage interview with Jason Wu minutes before his show, he said, “Of course, there’s always going to be dreamy gowns but you might see a sexy side of Jason Wu that you may not be so familiar with—but get used to it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fashion-trends-2023-mango.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=semi-transparent-knitted-sweater>Semi-Transparent Knitted Sweater</h2><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>This yellow sheer set</a> is perfect for spring and summer—it’s sheer without being super revealing so you’ll be able to comfortably wear it to dinner or on your vacation. <a href=# rel=nofollow>The skirt</a> includes little shorts as lining.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fashion-trends-2023-zara-.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=rigid-hem-mesh-tank-top>Rigid Hem Mesh Tank Top</h2><p>Mesh is the ultimate sheer fabric for spring and summer because it will keep you cool without being sweaty. <a href=# rel=nofollow>This green tank</a> has the coolest wire-inspired hemline.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/tassels.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=total-tassels>Total Tassels</h2><p class=has-text-align-center>Remember when feathers bordered every sleeve and hemline? Well, they’ve officially been replaced by tassels and fringe. Tassel trim is traditionally neutral-toned which makes it a great option for wardrobe minimalists and a wide range of designers. Brands like Bevza (known for elevated neutrals) to Bronx and Banco, a party-goers go-to, embraced long fringe.</p><p class=has-text-align-center>In an exclusive interview with Bronx and Banco designer, Natalie De’Banco, I got an inside scoop regarding the shift from the luxe night-life aesthetics we saw in her Fall/Winter ’22 collection to the earth-toned glam we saw for Spring/Summer ’23, “Since our resort collection was super bright <span class=searchHighlight>and</span> colorful, we are keeping the palate neutral <span class=searchHighlight>and</span> calming with blacks <span class=searchHighlight>and</span> beiges. That said, there won’t be a lack of color. We are using splashes of electric peach, lipstick coral <span class=searchHighlight>and</span> neon lime to add excitement to the collection.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center>The textured tassel trim will be the ultimate party trick come spring 2023 but there’s no reason why you need to wait to wear the trend. Tassels and fringe look incredible when incorporated with a neutral sweater, hanging from suede boots, and on the back of a heavy leather or suede jacket.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fashion-trends-2023-geisha-designs-.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=fringed-mini-dress>Fringed Mini Dress</h2><p>If you’re heading on a tropical vacation (jealous!) or throwing an epic party,&nbsp; you’ll absolutely want to wear <a href=# rel=nofollow>this blue number</a>. This dress is a total showstopper and all eyes will be on you.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fashion-trends-2023-delfi-collective-.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=scoop-neck-ombre-fringe-dress>Scoop-Neck Ombre Fringe Dress</h2><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>This ombre dress</a> would be incredible for any spring or summer wedding you have on your docket. Since it’s long-sleeved, you’ll be able to wear it well into the fall too.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screen-Shot-2023-05-22-at-3.42.30-PM.png><p class=has-text-align-center>It looks like fashion designers were just as excited as everyone else about the new The Little Mermaid&nbsp;movie release. With gadgets, gizmos, dresses and accessories a-plenty, Mermaidcore is the latest aesthetic to hit the runways and the big screen. Want to jump in? You’ll need seashell-inspired bralettes, sequin skirts and knit coverups to wear over your bikini. Mermaidcore is all about taking ocean-inspired pieces and pairing them with your classic summer wardrobe items.</p><p class=has-text-align-center>Designers like Blumarine have taken a more literal approach to mermaidcore with multiple iterations of a seashell bra top incorporated into the spring/summer ’23 collection. Bottega Veneta made an aquamarine skirt that could take you from the office to the ocean.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screen-Shot-2023-05-22-at-4.17.53-PM.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=classic-scalloped-bikini-bottoms>Classic Scalloped Bikini Bottoms</h2><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>This bikini</a> comes in three colors and gives major mermaid vibes with shell detailing on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">the top</a> and matching bottoms.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screen-Shot-2023-05-22-at-4.30.36-PM.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=low-back-slip-mermaid-fishtail-gown>Low Back Slip Mermaid Fishtail Gown</h2><p>Bring mermaidcore to any special occasion with <a href=# rel=nofollow>this sexy pink gown</a> with a fishtail hemline. The shimmery material will make it look like you just emerged from the ocean.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screen-Shot-2023-05-22-at-3.41.42-PM.png><p class=has-text-align-center>I hope you’re not tired of the rosette trend yet because it’s not going anywhere. Rosettes are perhaps the most delicate trend to dominate the summer fashion sphere. Whether you’re shopping for a hair accessory, bridal look, going-out top or pair of shoes, there’s a good chance you can find what you’re looking for with a rosette attached. Blumarine can be credited for bringing the vintage trend back last year and since then, brands like Sandy Liang and Mirro Palais have hopped on board.</p><p class=has-text-align-center>Many celebrities love the rosette trend too. Most notably, Harry Styles wore a giant version of the trend to the 2023 Brit Awards and Zendaya basically wore an entire rose garden to the 2023 SAG Awards. This trend works for any occasion and is easy to incorporate with a variety of fashion aesthetics. If you haven’t tried it yet, what are you waiting for?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screen-Shot-2023-05-22-at-4.55.20-PM.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=priscilla-top>Priscilla Top</h2><p>I love how <a href=# rel=nofollow>this off-the-shoulder top</a> mixes a classic color combination with the trendy rosette detail. Wear this top with jeans for a laidback look or dress it up with a maxi skirt.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screen-Shot-2023-05-22-at-5.05.43-PM.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=rosie-heels>Rosie Heels</h2><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>These heels</a> are so romantic and will be the ultimate addition to any formalwear or summer wedding look. They also come in a red rose color option.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screen-Shot-2023-05-22-at-3.58.48-PM.png><p class=has-text-align-center>If you’re a Swiftie, you’ll love this trend. Runways and Instagram feeds are turning lavender as the color emerges as the top color of the summer. Designers like Victoria Beckham and Laquan Smith presented beautiful examples of how the shade can be incorporated into summer dressing with two-piece sets while Christian Cowan took a colorful approach to suiting. Lavender is a calming color and can therefore be worn head-to-toe without coming across as overbearing. If you’re planning on attending a summer wedding, lavender is an excellent color option for a dress or suit.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screen-Shot-2023-05-22-at-5.16.41-PM.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=myla-dress>Myla Dress</h2><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>This dress</a> will be your go-to pick all summer long. You can wear it on a beach vacay, a bachelorette or just with white sneakers to the farmer’s market.</p><p><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-price data-transform data-truncate>$225 (was $375)</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screen-Shot-2023-05-22-at-5.21.19-PM.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=rhinestone-mini-tote-bag>Rhinestone Mini Tote Bag</h2><p>If the Eras Tour is on your summer calendar, <a href=# rel=nofollow>this sparkly lavender bag</a> would make the perfect accessory.</p><p><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-price data-transform data-truncate>$22.99 (was $35.90)</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/a-new-day-lavender-dress.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=a-new-day-women-s-mini-a-line-dress>A New Day Women’s Mini A-Line Dress</h2><p>We can’t think of anything more fun to wear this summer than this <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">lavender sequined dress</a>. Pair it with the above bag for the ultimate duo.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/obliquecutouts.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=oh-yes-obliques>Oh Yes, Obliques</h2><p class=has-text-align-center>This past summer, cut-outs were everywhere, specifically a double oblique cut-out (like on <a href=# rel=noopener>this viral Cult Gaia dress</a>). Cut-outs continued to dominate formal wear on the New York runways but this time, designers were picking a side. One-sided oblique cutouts were everywhere and on everyone—Gigi Hadid rocked the look at Tom Ford and Karlie Kloss wore a one-shoulder iteration at Carolina Herrera. The style is a great way to emphasize your waist, show a little skin and play up any simple gown.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2023-04-10-at-4.51.24-PM.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=kristin-dress>Kristin Dress</h2><p>Barbiecore pink isn’t going anywhere and neither are oblique cut-outs. Get the best of both worlds with <a href=# rel=nofollow>this sexy black gown.&nbsp;</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fashion-trends-2023-farm-rio.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=orange-one-shoulder-midi-dress>Orange One Shoulder Midi Dress</h2><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>This bright orange dress</a> will be your favorite thing to wear when the weather is warm. Plus, the bright color will earn you lots of compliments.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/petal-pip-cut-out-dress.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=petal-and-pup-womens-alexa-cut-out-dress>Petal and Pup Womens Alexa Cut Out Dress</h2><p>Speaking of bright colors, why not add this <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">bright red number</a> into your wardrobe, too?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cityschoolgirl.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=city-school-girl>City School Girl</h2><p class=has-text-align-center>If you visit Manhattan’s Lower East Side neighborhood right now, you’ll see a strong presence of the city school aesthetic. The look takes elements of the demure, girly school aesthetic (plaid skirts, ruffled collars and pink bows) and fuses them with street-style grunge (heavy piercings, lug sole shoes and mesh layering). At the heart of the neighborhood, you’ll also find Sandy Liang’s storefront—looking out onto the street with a front-row view of the aesthetic she’s helped craft. It’s no wonder then that Sandy Liang’s S/S ‘23 collection was a direct reflection of the environment with girly-grunge pastel mini dresses. Liang paired the looks with ballet flats (the trend is here to stay!) or sleek sporty sneakers. Similar versions of the ensemble were also seen at Coach and Maya Seyferth. If you’re eager to create your own version of the city school aesthetic, I’d recommend browsing the racks at your local vintage store first.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/pretty-garden-ruffle-dress.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=prettygarden-midi-dress>PRETTYGARDEN Midi Dress</h2><p><a data-pmc-sp-product=f605d727a40a7f7b19114c58470b13d2 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"This girly dress","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"PRETTYGARDEN Women&#39;s Casual Summer Midi Dress Puffy Short Sleeve Square Neck Smocked Tiered Ruffle Dresses (Light Blue,Small)","price":"40.79","id":"B0BM39KPCC","category":"Casual"},"id":1329520,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>This girly dress</a> can easily be given a city edge with a pair of platform boots, sporty sunglasses and a worn-out leather bag.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fashion-trends-2023-for-love-and-lemons.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=isadora-midi-dress>Isadora Midi Dress</h2><p>Lean into the floral side of the girly grunge aesthetic with <a href=# rel=nofollow>this floral midi dress</a> complete with puff sleeves.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/dipdye.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=dressed-up-dip-dye>Dressed Up Dip-Dye</h2><p class=has-text-align-center>It seems like just yesterday we were all wearing homemade tie-dye sweatsuits as a result of quarantine-induced boredom. Designers seem to think that enough time has passed for you to move past any tie-dye burnout and have introduced a more elegant version of the trend for 2023 with dip-dye. Dip-dye encompasses the same multi-tone color story as tie-dye without all the neon swirls. The subdued ombré coloring gives garments a one-of-kind appearance and naturally showed up on Ulla Johnson’s boho runway and on Peter Do’s. Though dip-dye may seem like a more casual trend, designers like Altuzarra upgraded the look to formal wear with dip-dyed gowns.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fashion-trends-2023-vince.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=ombre-long-sleeve-crewneck-top><span class=product-heading__name__product>Ombré Long Sleeve Crewneck Top&nbsp;</span></h2><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>This Vince long sleeve</a> is incredibly soft and easy to layer.
