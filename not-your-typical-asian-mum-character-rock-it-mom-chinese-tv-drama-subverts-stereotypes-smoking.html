She is the type of mother that is not seen on Chinese screens.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Chinese literary works portray mothers in two broad categories: ‘loving’ and ‘evil’ mothers,” Jie Yilin, a PhD student in Renmin University of China wrote in her film and television studies research. Women are, she wrote, solely seen through the lens of motherhood, and their devotion to and tolerance for their children are a given.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“But the point is, [she] is firstly an individual, then a woman and finally a mother,” she adds.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/10/27/4eec5eb6-c991-4fcd-8a11-439360d2387c_eb9026fa.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This is exactly why Peng stands out. Despite being a mother, she always puts herself first. Peng is a wayward rock star who flies to the United States to pursue her dreams and leaves both her husband and child behind.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Twelve years later, when she turns 40, she returns home to look after her daughter Bai Tian (Zhuang Dafei) after her ex-partner dies of a heart attack. The mother-daughter reunion is far from heartwarming – Peng, who yearns for freedom, is reckless and irresponsible.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">‘Meet my mum’: cute Chinese boy introduces best friend to mother in viral video</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In most Chinese dramas that revolve around mother-daughter relationships, the daughter is the problem child.

I can understand her indifference and ‘selfishness’.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It is this complex portrayal that makes Peng an interesting character – her husband cheats on her not long after she falls pregnant with Bai Tian.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Her childhood, too, was far from pleasant – after she was abandoned by her mother, she was left to the mercies of her alcoholic aunt.
