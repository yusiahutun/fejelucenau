Since there are various reasons why your phone's microphone may malfunction, let's go through different ways to fix your problem.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h3 id=restart-and-check-for-updates>1. Restart and Check for Updates</h3><p>Sometimes the easiest solution is the best solution. Restarting your smartphone refreshes your system by clearing all processes and open apps. It can be a quick fix to your problem.</p><p>Hold the <strong>power</strong> button until the menu appears, then choose <strong>Power > Power off</strong>. Leave it off for 30-60 seconds before turning it back on, then check to see if the problem is resolved.</p><p>If a quick restart doesn't work, check for software updates, which is located under <strong>Settings > System > Advanced > System update</strong> or similar. A new software update usually fixes any bugs/errors that the current version may have, which could affect your microphone.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h3 id=clean-your-phone-s-microphone>2. Clean Your Phone's Microphone</h3><p>If you don't clean your phone every once in a while, dirt can build up in the small openings of your device, like the microphone port. Simply wiping your phone is not enough, as dust or other small debris can get packed in.</p><p>Your mic is a small hole or other port located beside the USB connector, usually at the bottom of your phone. Grab a small pin, thin needle, or similar and use it to gently clean your mic. The other alternative is to blow directly at it, to remove all the built-up debris. However, if you do this, be careful not to blow air further into the phone.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/android-mic-cleaning-tool.jpeg><p>Another aspect to check while cleaning for is your case or screen protector. When you place a new protective item on your phone, there's a chance that you'll cover your mic with it. Make sure that no part of your case is blocking your mic, and that there's no dust buildup trapped inside crevices of your case either.</p><p>You can adapt our <a href=#>guide to cleaning your iPhone</a> and apply most of the same steps to avoid facing this problem again in the future.</p><h3 id=configure-sound-settings>3. Configure Sound Settings</h3><p>Some Android phones come with a feature called noise suppression or noise reduction. Noise suppression helps reduce the background noise when you are on a call or recording a video.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>For those unaware of this, the result can sound a bit disorientating, so it's easy to assume there is something wrong with your mic. Here's how you can disable the setting to make sure your mic is fine:</p><li>Go to the <strong>Settings</strong> app.</li><li>Select <strong>Call Settings</strong> or <strong>Sound Settings</strong>.</li><li>Look for the <strong>Noise Reduction</strong> option and disable it.</li><li>Restart your phone and check if the problem is solved.</li><p>Please note that not all Android phones come with this feature, and it may appear in a different location for you.</p><p>Aside from this option, there's also the chance that you left your phone connected to a Bluetooth headset or other device with a microphone. If that's the case, your phone will use that as the primary microphone instead of the built-in one.</p><p>Make sure to check what's currently connected under <strong>Settings > Connected devices</strong>. Disable any active Bluetooth devices and try using the mic again to fix your problem.</p>2 Images <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/01b-Android-Bluetooth-Settings.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/03a-Android-Bluetooth-Device-Options.png> <span class=txt>Close</span><h3 id=check-for-third-party-app-interference>4. Check for Third-Party App Interference</h3><p>Third-party apps are one of the biggest causes of phone malfunctioning. They can interfere with your phone's settings; many people experience irregularities but think of them as nothing more than glitches. In this way, apps that can access your microphone might be the cause of your current issues.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>To determine if your mic issues are due to a third-party app or not, you should run your phone in safe mode, which disables all third-party apps temporarily.</p><p>Here's how to activate safe mode on your phone when it's already on:</p><li>Press and hold your phone's <strong>Power</strong> button.</li><li>On your screen, touch and hold the <strong>Power off</strong> option.</li><li>Afterward, you should see <strong>Safe mode</strong> at the bottom of your screen. Select this to reboot into safe mode.</li><p>If your phone is off, do the following:</p><li>Hold your phone's <strong>Power</strong> button to boot as normal.</li><li>When the animation starts, press and hold your phone's <strong>volume down</strong> button. Keep holding it until the animation ends and your phone starts in safe mode.</li><li>You will see <strong>Safe mode</strong> appear at the bottom of your screen to confirm.</li><p>Now that you're in safe mode, perform a test call or use your recorder app to check the microphone. If your mic is working fine in safe mode, then the issue lies with an app. You can find a list of apps that use your mic in the Settings menu.</p><p>Go to <strong>Settings > Apps & notifications > Advanced > Permission manager > Microphone</strong>.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong> 3 Images <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/android-mic-permissions-screenshot-1.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/android-mic-permissions-screenshot-2.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/android-mic-permissions-screenshot-3.jpeg> <span class=txt>Close</span><p>If you have installed sound amplifier or enhancer apps, they are most likely the culprit. Otherwise, try checking the apps that you suspect are the cause, revoke their mic access, then test your mic to see if they were the cause.</p><h3 id=take-it-to-a-technician>5. Take It to a Technician</h3><p>If all else fails, there is a good chance your phone is damaged. Mics are delicate parts and can easily break from fall, water, or similar damage.
