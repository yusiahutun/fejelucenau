The two friends from Mobile, Ala., have built a grassroots following&nbsp;that appreciate their lyrical depth as much as their live energy. Dispatch&nbsp;to 16th Ave. landed on Taste of Country's&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Best&nbsp;Albums of 2022</a> list on the strength of its ability to showcase both skills with ease.</p><p>The independent duo's&nbsp;toured with mentors like <a href=#>Kip Moore</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Whiskey Myers</a>&nbsp;and<a href=#>&nbsp;Luke Combs</a>,&nbsp;and for this new album wrote with B.J. Barnham, the driving force of <a href=#>American Aquarium</a>. While energetic and positive about their future, it's clear they're committed to serving music and fans first. A recording contract that asks them to change just isn't going to happen.</p><p>"One thing we decided is that, creatively, we’re done with advice," Muncaster<a href=#> told ToC in 2022</a>. "We’re done hearing it from anybody. It’s not on our heart to make it, it’s like we’re not gonna make it that way. And if it is on our heart to make it that way, then that’s the bible."</p><p>The new album promises stories of growing up in the American south. It's a "love letter to their youth" that includes what a press release calls a sequel to "The Devil Went Down&nbsp;to Georgia" (Track 9 perhaps). An expansion of what they did well on their last effort seems likely. "Teenage Dixie" qualifies, as&nbsp;does the unreleased "Pocketful of '90s Country," released to social media last week.</p><h3>Muscadine Bloodline's&nbsp;Teenage Dixie Tracklist:</h3><p>1.

Only one artist found below notched a solo No. 1 country airplay hit this year. Popularity doesn't always equal quality.</p>It’s not that albums from country music’s most notable hitmakers aren’t any good. Count <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke Combs</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Thomas Rhett</a> as strong honorable mentions for this list but both were edged out by a group that in some ways didn’t have to worry about the confines of commercial success. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Randy Houser</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Muscadine Bloodline</a> are independant artists. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">American Aquarium</a> is too and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ashley McBryde</a> released the sort of album you’d expect from an indy act.&nbsp;<p>The lesson is country fans need to look deeper for the most daring, creative music of 2022.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmpq2jmK6ltc2eZJukn6SxrbXNnmStnZWjrqixjJ2gsaGVYq6trtSmZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
