Cardi further fueled the rumors when she posted about “outgrowing relationships” on her Instagram Story. “I’m tired of protecting peoples feelings…I GOTTA PUT MYSELF FIRST,” the <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>mom-of-two</a> wrote. Cardi also went on an Instagram Live and spoke about dropping “dead weight,” signaling a clear problem in the couple’s dynamic.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>The rappers have had an <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>up-and-down relationship</a> since they got married in 2017. They split for the first time in 2018 following the birth of their daughter&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kulture</strong></a>, 5. Offset <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>admitted to cheating</a> on Cardi and offered her a public apology, and she decided to take him back. In 2020, Cardi filed for divorce and noted in her court filing that “there are no prospects for a reconciliation.” However, the stars managed to patch up their marriage and they <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>called off their divorce</a>. They welcomed their second child, son <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Wave</strong></a>, in September 2021.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Earlier this year, the pair dealt with more drama in their relationship when Offset publicly accused Cardi of cheating on him in an Instagram message that he later deleted. But when the <strong>Migos</strong> rapper appeared on the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Way Up With Angela Yee</a> podcast, he claimed that he lied about the accusation and did it as a way to threaten Cardi during a fight.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>“It’s <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>my wife</a>, I love her to death, and we’re going back and forth,” he explained. “If you got a New York woman…she’s a pit bull. She get crazy at the mouth a little bit. And I was really lit that night.” Offset also said he wouldn’t be addressing the situation any further. “At the end of the day, them people don’t really know what’s going on with us for real,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH5ze5BqZpyZopm2bq6MnKannpmnurR50qmjoqxdm7%2BwuYyonZ%2Brlal6orrDZqqasaNiwKmx0maqoqaXobJw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
