Earlier this month, Lily Collins <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/p/C2SUQK-AIN5/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=a76ccfcc-d240-42be-bdac-145857638e32&img_index=1" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="posted a selfie" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">posted a selfie</a> on Instagram, posing with a script for the new season, for a table read dated 17 January 2024 (she also wore an Eiffel Tower-adorned shirt, a nod to her titular character). "Did someone say Saison Quatre?!

"So much happened that we just need answers to," she says. "Is Alfie still heartbroken? Will Gabriel get his Michelin star? Will Mindy and the band go to Eurovision? And what about Camille? Will Sylvie's rekindled love last? I wish I could tell you more, but you'll just have to wait to find out." It's safe to say that season four has a lot to unpack.</p><img alt="emily in paris" title="emily in paris" width=3000 height=1500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/eip-107-unit-00265r-1600267472.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Netflix</span></p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">What do we know about the plot?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the teaser video, Collins might not reveal much – but she does let slip that the drama will only keep ramping up in season four, noting that Emily’s life will take "some unexpected twists" and teasing both a Roman holiday and hard choices ahead for the expat. "Emily is going to have to decide if everything she’s ever wanted is really what she needs," she says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">More exact plot points for season four haven't yet been revealed, but Emily In Paris creator Darren Star has given some hints in recent interviews. "Season 4 is going to be more about navigating complicated relationships; personal relationships and work relationships, and how they come into conflict with each other," explained Star in <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.tvguide.com/news/emily-in-paris-season-4-release-date-cast-and-everything-to-know/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="an interview with TV Guide" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">an interview with TV Guide</a>. "Emily is still going to be working with Alfie, Gabriel, and Camille. Those work relationships are really fraught with emotional conflicts."</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Life Lessons with Lily Collins" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/hbz-ll-lilycollins-1-copy-6424342a8e9ec.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="emily in paris lily collins as emily in episode 303 of emily in paris cr courtesy of netflix copy 2022" title="&amp;ldquo;Emily in Paris&amp;rdquo; Season Four: What We Know" width=2500 height=1406 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/emily-in-paris-s3-e3-00-26-15-13rc-1672081832.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Netflix</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And what about Camille and Gabriel's bombshell baby news? While season four will of course focus on the unexpected pregnancy, Star told <a href=# data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.etonline.com/emily-in-paris-cast-reacts-to-season-3-pregnancy-shocker-exclusive-196223 data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Entertainment Tonight" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Entertainment Tonight</a> that he's "not sure we're going to actually see a baby" in the upcoming episodes – but mainly because the show "doesn't move that quickly" and "one season really covers a couple of months". It's more likely the plot will centre on Camille's pregnancy.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Unfortunately, Star didn't give too much detail away when it comes to Emily and Gabriel. But in an interview with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://deadline.com/2022/12/emily-in-paris-creator-darren-star-qa-season-3-finale-wedding-cliffhanger-season-4-theme-spoilers-1235202040/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Deadline class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Deadline</a>, he touched on the dynamics they will have to face in season four: "They are star-crossed lovers, they really are. And I think that a big question to think about the next season is, Emily didn’t come to Paris for romance, she came for a job, and I think they’re both in a different, more mature place in their lives, Emily and Gabriel, and definitely a more complicated place."</p><img alt="emily in paris l to r lily collins as emily, lucien laviscount as alfie in episode 209 of emily in paris cr steacute phanie branchunetflix copy 2021" title="Emily in Paris" width=3600 height=2400 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/emily-in-paris-new-1641893645.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">STÉPHANIE BRANCHU/NETFLIX</span></p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Who will be starring in season four of Emily in Paris?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Though Netflix has yet to officially confirm the season four cast, most of the show’s main players are near-guaranteed to return, including Collins, Ashley Park (Mindy), Lucas Bravo (Gabriel), Camille Razat (Camille), Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu (Sylvie), Samuel Arnold (Julien), and Bruno Gouery (Luc).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As for Lucien Laviscount’s Alfie, who left Emily after learning about her feelings for Gabriel, the jury is out.

News</a>, Laviscount teased the future of his character in season four: "I don't know if I'm back," he admitted to the publication during an Oscars after-party, suggesting anyone who wants to know should "talk to Darren". For his part, Star has hinted to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.tvguide.com/news/emily-in-paris-season-4-release-date-cast-and-everything-to-know/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="TV Guide" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">TV Guide</a> that the Brit will likely still be part of the show, as Emily will have to balance working with him along with her own lingering feelings.</p><img alt="emily in paris l to r ashley park as mindy, lily collins as emily in episode 302 of emily in paris cr steacutephanie branchunetflix copy 2022" title="Emily in Paris" width=3000 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/emily-in-paris-ashley-lily-64242af73f577.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Netflix</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In an interview with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://deadline.com/2022/12/emily-in-paris-creator-darren-star-qa-season-3-finale-wedding-cliffhanger-season-4-theme-spoilers-1235202040/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Deadline class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Deadline</a>, Star kept news of Alfie's return vague: "I don’t think romantically he is in the picture [anymore]. I don’t think that makes Alfie out of the show. He certainly has a reason to be in Paris, and he’s working with Gabriel. I feel like all of our characters are still connected, just in a more complicated way."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">One cast member who likely won’t return is Kate Walsh, as season three saw Madeline decide to shut down the branch and return to Chicago.
