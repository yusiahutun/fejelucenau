The major difference between OG jeans and maternity jeans is the waistline, as your growing baby bump needs to be accommodated. This can be achieved via over-the-bump or under-the-bump styles (more on that below!) We <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>conducted extensive testing</a> on maternity jeans as well as interviewed a panel of experts—all fashion stylists, influencers, and yes, moms, who have worn the styles—to compile a list of the best maternity jeans in every category.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-over-belly-1822-denim-maternity-better-butter-slim-straight-with-bellyband></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall, Over Belly</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>1822 Denim Maternity Better Butter Slim Straight with Bellyband</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=999 data-sizes=750px alt="1822 Denim Maternity Better Butter Slim Straight with Bellyband" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/9FK83k9nkS9AJXhufvvFZ0v1TXc=/fit-in/1500x999/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/1822-Denim-Maternity-Better-Butter-Slim-Straight-with-Bellyband-074d465623974da684e5051c50b94b7a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>1822 Denim</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Fit</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Support</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love</strong>: You don’t have to worry about these soft-as-butter (and wallet-friendly) maternity jeans slipping down off your bump.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love</strong>: We wish there were more color options.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This over-the-belly style from 1822 Denim is one of the most comfortable maternity jeans on the market. We found the high-quality fabric really does feel like butter — or at least on par with the most comfortable leggings in your closet. The belly band was snug enough to stay in place, but not restrictive or too compressive, like many other over-the-bump styles. It is also stretchy enough to grow with you into the third trimester. And, as one of the lower priced maternity jeans we tested, you get a lot of bang for your buck: One pair is likely to last you at least another pregnancy. Unfortunately, the straight-leg style only comes in one color option.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 24–33 | <strong>Washes: </strong>1 | <strong>Fit:</strong> Over-the-bump</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-under-belly-hudson-jeans-nico-maternity-straight-ankle-jean></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall, Under Belly</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Hudson Jeans Nico Maternity Straight Ankle Jean</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Hudson Jeans Nico Maternity Straight Ankle Jean" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Oi6FsgIwpqOjPLl5X0a4f_cMj3A=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Nico-Maternity-Straight-Ankle-Jean--5541f36fa38e499abda0558e54caa511.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Hudson Jeans</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Fit</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Support</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love</strong>: Finally, a non-maternity maternity jean that will make you feel like you are rocking “real” clothes during all stages of your pregnancy.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love</strong>: Designer denim comes at a steep price, but this style is well worth the splurge.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Under belly maternity jeans make a great investment, as you can wear them the moment your belly starts growing until post-pregnancy. Think of Hudson’s Nico style as the non-maternity maternity jean — unless you look close and see the subtly camouflaged side panels, you can’t really tell the difference. As Hudson is a premium denim brand, you get what you pay for: An ultra luxe, comfortable pair of jeans that make you feel like the best version of yourself. We found they were well worth the nearly $200 investment for three trimesters plus postpartum wear especially if you are looking for jeans that make you feel like you are wearing “real” clothes. The style is so popular with women in all stages of pregnancy that it comes in four washes, including a black coated, faux leather looking style for when you need a little fashion pick-me-up. Don’t even think about sizing up, as they run true to size.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 23–34 | <strong>Washes: </strong>4 | <strong>Fit:</strong> Under-the-bump</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-levis-signature-by-levi-strauss--co-gold-label-womens-maternity-skinny-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Levi's Maternity Skinny Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Levi's Signature by Levi Strauss &amp;amp; Co.

This budget-friendly but high-quality pair of maternity jeans available on Amazon was recommended by nearly everyone on our expert roster and testers. “These Levi Strauss & Co Skinny jeans are a classic and they are a great price too,” explains <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Lucy Aylen</a>, a stylist, mom, and founder of Never Fully Dressed. Gillette adds that the skinny style has the “perfect amount of stretch” while still managing to stay up without constant readjustment. We found that the thickness and stiffness of the band made for great belly support, but don’t expect too much in the form of back support. For the price, you can’t go wrong. Even after several washes there was zero pilling, fading or stretching out. Available in three color options and sizes XS to XL. We suggest sizing up as they run a little on the small side.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> XS–XL | <strong>Washes:</strong> 3 | <strong>Fit:</strong> Under-the-bump<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-1st-or-2nd-trimester-hudson-rosie-maternity-wide-leg-ankle-jean></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for 1st or 2nd Trimester</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Hudson Rosie Maternity Wide Leg Ankle Jean</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Hudson Rosie Maternity Wide Leg Ankle Jean" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/yS2iNLgjAPbfV9XQcoPH0NYMo3E=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Hudson-Rosie-Maternity-Wide-Leg-Ankle-Jean-8b588ed5676d46efa40ba29f30a66af2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Hudson</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Fit</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Support</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love</strong>: This wide-leg designer style offers serious cool girl vibes paired with below-the-bump comfort.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love</strong>: The side panels might not offer sufficient bump and back support for the final trimester.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For those who like a wider leg style, Hudson’s Rosie offers some serious cool girl vibes. Made from “premium stretch denim designed to hold their shape,” fashion expert, designer and mom <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Maggie Gillette</a> maintains that the slight flare is perfect for pairing with a wedge or heel “for a dressed-up look.” The fabric is smooth and lightweight with the side panels resting just below the bump for comfort. While it may be possible for some women to wear them throughout the entirety of pregnancy, we found that due to the lack of support around the back and bump, the style is better suited for the first and second trimesters. If you do plan on wearing them throughout all three, consider sizing up. Overall the on-trend style offers a more designer denim feel than less expensive options. So, if you don’t mind splurging a little, they are well worth the investment.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 23–34 | <strong>Washes: </strong>1 | <strong>Fit:</strong> Under-the-bump</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-3rd-trimester-hatch-the-over-the-bump-slim-maternity-jean></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for 3rd Trimester</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Hatch Slim Maternity Jean</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Hatch The Over the Bump Slim Maternity Jean" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ZGBFelajVDImiIQQqomkj0FPJuY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/hatch-the-over-the-bump-slim-maternity-jean-815c126119294757957d82f1d151510f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Hatch</p></span><p><strong>What We Love</strong>: High-quality, durable jeans with a built-in belly panel offering extra support for the third trimester.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love</strong>: Only available in one length.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Hatch, the premium maternity brand that outfitted Meghan Markle, Olivia Wilde and Kate Upton during their pregnancies, have nailed the maternity denim category, says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Lauren Rae Levy Vigneron</a>, a Los Angeles-based stylist, consultant and founder of the LRL Group. “These skinny maternity jeans made from recycled cotton, come with a built in belly panel made up of a breathable bamboo blend and stretch,” she says about the jeans that got her through her pregnancy. Just how comfortable are they? We maintain that the ultra-soft panel will trick you into thinking you are wearing a pair of leggings.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Designed to grow with you through all stages of pregnancy, including the third trimester and postpartum, the panel provides the support needed around your bump and for your lower back, she adds. “Bonus points for being c-section friendly and wonderfully crafted to give that perfect amount of postpartum compression,” she says. (Our tester did note that she found the panel a little too restrictive and wished she had sized up.) Vigneron also loves the “perfect indigo wash” that goes with pretty much everything and “will become a core piece of your maternity wardrobe.” And while on the expensive side, after several washes they still looked as good as new with zero piling or fading.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 24–34 | <strong>Washes: </strong>1 | <strong>Fit:</strong> Over-the-bump</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-lagence-selma-maternity-jean></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>L'Agence Maternity Jean</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="L'Agence Selma Maternity Jean" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/tVVmzVL-PsHEqxxlG2hwbv-aKO0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/lagence-selma-maternity-jean-1b1e7d01326f493da2abb07c2873f9c8.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>L'Agence</p></span><p><strong>What We Love</strong>: Simply put, it’s “the most flattering maternity jean on the market.”</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love</strong>: These only come in a black denim wash.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you are going to splurge on one pair of maternity jeans, Vigneron recommends this pair from L’Agence, which she dubs “the most flattering maternity jean on the market” with a high rise, straight leg and boot cut. “If you are looking to splurge on mama-to-be jeans, this premium denim style is the one for you,” she says. The jeans have stretch panels built into the front pockets for extra comfort, so “not only do they look great, but feel great,” she maintains.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Unfortunately, they come in one wash, “a clean true black denim,” but “every detail was designed with love,” she says,&nbsp; including the button “which is monochromatic to give this pant a more elevated look.” If you prefer skinny jeans, their <a href=#

model, entrepreneur and mother-of-two, plus size maternity is limited to a very small handful of stores, “so to identify a best of the best is very difficult,” she maintains. “Most stores don’t offer past a 3XL and at some stores the 3XL that is offered is more a junior plus cut which means they are technically stopping at a 18/20.” Overall her favorite style of denim is definitely the over-the-belly, as it offers the best support and rounds out the belly a little better, “plus it gave me a little more coverage on both ends which I needed the later I became in my pregnancy,” she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">She selected this style from Motherhood Maternity as her top pick, due to the combo of fit, cut, accessibility and cost. “The cut is trendy and fun, the style is overall comfortable to wear,” she says. “They are a little lightweight but they held up great throughout my pregnancy.” She owned both colors, “but the light wash was definitely on heavy rotation.” This style is very popular and will go out of stock in sizes or colors, but the brand does restock.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base

Made out of a durable high quality denim with just a little bit of spandex, the jeans moved with us for all day comfort. Due to the stretchiness of the belly band, we found them to be a great option for the third trimester, as the band is big enough to accommodate a larger bump. However, those in the first or second trimester (or with smaller bellies) may have trouble keeping the over-the-bump band in place.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 24–31 | <strong>Washes: </strong>1 | <strong>Fit:</strong> Over-the-bump</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-14 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=2016 data-sizes=750px alt="A person stretching the hem of the PinkBlush Blue Medium Wash Maternity Skinny Jeans while wearing them" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/HFWyCRE6avqmCYuv3nK5UtStNoo=/fit-in/1500x2016/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-maternity-jeans-test-pinkblush-blue-medium-wash-skinny-andrea-tenborg-5-fcabd95e95324b5c8f85929a2668d807.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Andrea Tenborg</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=2014 data-sizes=750px alt="A pregnant person wearing the PinkBlush Blue Medium Wash Maternity Skinny Jeans" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/sq4O2bG-ZqmUU4jhF2CAB-mRvnQ=/fit-in/1500x2014/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-maternity-jeans-test-pinkblush-blue-medium-wash-skinny-andrea-tenborg-1-b4f4af614ebd47a2adf0526877c8f8c8.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Andrea Tenborg</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-skinny-runner-up-blanqi-maternity-belly-support-skinny-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Skinny, Runner Up</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>BLANQI Maternity Belly Support Skinny Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="BLANQI Maternity Belly Support Skinny Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/LsCrGokrVwEz1XBJjOje6-53vEI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/blanqi-maternity-belly-support-skinny-jeans-b95b7ac935b146aea4a972a8e4475581.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>BLANQI</p></span><p><strong>What We Love</strong>: This over-the-belly skinny style comes in six color options and costs under $130.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love</strong>: The stellar style doesn’t come in plus sizes or various lengths.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These “great-fitting” pull-on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>skinny jeans</a> were a “staple” in Vigneron’s pregnancy journey. “The over-the-belly seamless support band brings the support one needs throughout the stages of pregnancy,” she says about the high-quality, reasonably priced style that comes in six washes and sizes 0 to 14. The over-the-bump band is also made out of the same microfiber they use for the ultra-comfy leggings. “I’m a big fan of the “medium clean” wash for fall, “black knee slit” for winter, and the “light destroy” for spring/ summer,” she says. An added bonus? “Blanqi crafts their denim with sustainability using recycled cotton and wood pulp.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 0–14 | <strong>Washes: </strong>6 | <strong>Fit:</strong> Over-the-bump</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-wide-leg-paige-anessa-maternity-rock-show-distressed></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Wide Leg</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Paige Anessa Maternity Rock Show Distressed</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Paige Anessa Maternity Rock Show Distressed" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/2te3Ui6_vRU-3e3w8rjTiGSpSaI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/paige-anessa-maternity-rock-show-distressed-e08be2fbead947dba9422e6ca816b014.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Paige</p></span><p><strong>What We Love</strong>: This wide style from Paige is perfectly distressed and laid back.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love</strong>: The stretchy side panels are black and don’t blend in with the blue denim.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We love the more casual, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>wide leg design</a> on these Paige Anessa Maternity Jeans. The laid-back cut is “super stylish and high quality,” says Gillette. “The wide cut of the leg provides a balanced proportion to your pregnant body while still being comfortable.” The style comes in a single wash, a distressed blue dubbed rock show, from the brand’s vintage collection. It offers below-the-bump support via two stretchy side panels and features a cropped, billowy bottom.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The light wash is a nice shade, however we do wish the pregnancy panels were more discreet.

Her favorite feature? The monochromatic stretchy panels on the sides. “Typically panels built into maternity jeans are black or white, and I love that this style offers a more subtle approach to this by using blue panels on the sides,” she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While incredibly durable, our reviewer found the panels to be less stretchy than other styles, which might be a problem during the later stages of pregnancy. However, the leg and shape of these pants paired with the wash options (light or indigo) “make these beauties a great investment,” according to Vigneron. Be forewarned: Sizing is a little wonky, running on the larger side.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 24–34 | <strong>Washes: </strong>2 | <strong>Fit:</strong> Over-the-bump</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-cropped-paige-denim-noella-straight-leg-maternity-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Cropped</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Paige Denim Noella Straight Leg Maternity Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Paige Denim Noella Maternity Roam Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/SfzMrRbMiBtcBIHvFWHmmOlU-jQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Paige-Denim-Noella-Maternity---Roam-0f80de60736244d38323bd5da75bf5dc.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Paige Denim</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Fit</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Support</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love</strong>: These designer boyfriend-style jeans are stylish, comfortable and will last you through your pregnancy and into the next.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love</strong>: The low side panels aren’t going to provide ample back support.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Maternity jeans often get a bad rap for being dowdy. However, this cropped style from Paige is about as on-trend as you can get. Designed out of the brand’s trademark high-quality denim and grow-with-you under-the-bump side panels, you will be wearing this slightly loose, boyfriend-style on repeat throughout this pregnancy and into the next.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Due to the stretchy and loose nature of the material, the jeans provide all-day comfort. However, plan on washing them after a few wears, as they tend to get looser over time. Because the side panel bands are so low, you aren’t going to get the ample back support you might need during those final weeks, a common issue with under-the-bump styles.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 23–34 | <strong>Washes: </strong>1 | <strong>Fit:</strong> Under-the-bump</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Eliza Savage</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-cropped-runner-up-joes-jeans-the-icon-ankle-maternity></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Cropped, Runner Up</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Joe's Jeans The Icon Ankle Maternity</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Joe's Jeans The Icon Ankle Maternity" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/6byJOmtQFeIiVfAdn5APdNW_td4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/joes-jeans-the-icon-ankle-maternity-8a5faf0677f8488db61c87f58a3ae74a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Joe's Jeans</p></span><p><strong>What We Love</strong>: A clean, timeless skinny jean with just enough crop to wear with heels or sandals.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love</strong>: The stylist-approved cropped jean only comes in one wash.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For a cropped jean, Vigneron recommends this mid-rise skinny jean courtesy of Joes. “It comes in the perfect everyday shade of indigo, falls just above the ankle, and fits beautifully,” she says.

Add in an expanding belly and the roadblocks to your ideal fit increase. Your best bet is to find something with a lot of stretch. Lebron recommends this style from Oh! Mamma Maternity, a cotton, poly, rayon, spandex blend that will stretch with you. This style is also a great option for curvy or plus-size women as well as it comes in sizes S through 3X.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-74 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“If you are only planning to wear denim a handful of times during your pregnancy I highly recommend these because for under $20 (and sometimes as low as $12) you can’t go wrong,” she says, but don’t expect them to last throughout multiple pregnancies.

Featuring stretch panels on the sides, offering full range of motion for your bump, they are a great option for anyone who doesn’t love the over-the-bump look or feel. The fabric is incredibly soft and stretchy enough to grow with you throughout your pregnancy, while offering enough compression that you don’t have to keep pulling them up or readjusting. We found that if you are in need of extra belly or back support, this isn’t the pair for you.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-87 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The main con, according to our testers?

Somehow, the belly band manages to stay in place for hours on end without digging into the skin. While the fabric held up nicely throughout multiple wears and washes, those who are planning on having more children might want to consider investing in a more premium style, as these might not make it to baby number two.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-93 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 0—20 | <strong>Washes: </strong>1 | <strong>Fit:</strong> Over-the-bump</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-most-comfortable-signature-by-levi-strauss--co-womens-maternity-skinny-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Most Comfortable</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Signature by Levi Strauss & Co.

The stretchy soft cotton, polyester and elastane blend fabric is so soft and comfy you might forget you are wearing jeans and won’t feel the need to change into sweats the second you get home. The only con? While the smooth and stretchy material grows with you and won’t dig into your bump or sides, you aren’t going to get a whole lot of back support compared to other styles with a thicker band. While the jeans tend to stretch a little throughout the day, after a run through the washer and dryer they regain their shape.

But some people don't like the way it feels because of the extra sensation so the under-the-belly fit might work best for them.” Additionally, some people find that stretchy side panels aren’t the best option for the final stages of pregnancy, as they don’t offer a lot of support for the bump and back. The bottom line? Try some on and see what feels good. You also might want to invest in both styles, so you have options.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>When can I start wearing maternity jeans?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Depending on whether this is your first or subsequent pregnancy, you may start wearing maternity jeans at a different time, explains Cole. “With a first-time pregnancy, you don't normally need them until your late first trimester, or early second trimester.
