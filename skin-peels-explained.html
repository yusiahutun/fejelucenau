Very superficial peels work on the dead surface cells only, and can be performed in-clinic or at home with over-the-counter products (more on that below). In the clinic, superficial peels work on the epidermis, while medium-depth peels target both the epidermis and the upper dermis. Deep peels travel down to the lower layers of the dermis. “The exact strength of the peel should always be tailored to the patient’s individual skin and needs,” says Dr Williams.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Most superficial peels don’t involve much downtime. “Hydroxy-acid peels are great starter peels and also well suited to younger patients or those who prefer their skin not to be visibly flaking after treatment,” says Dr Williams. “Superficial peels are mild and the most commonly used type for improving skin texture and overall complexion. They work by removing part of the stratum corneum and sometimes the upper epidermis. They can improve <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/skincare/a37685934/hyperpigmentation-treatments/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=discolouration class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">discolouration</a>, surface roughness and texture, but also <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/skincare/a37526913/how-to-increase-collagen/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="stimulate collagen production" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">stimulate collagen production</a> via communication between epidermal and dermal cells. With a superficial peel, you’ll achieve a more refined skin surface with a fresher, more vibrant skin tone and improved skin texture,” she says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Medium-depth peels work particularly well for more mature skin with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/skincare/a32799913/sun-damage-skin-treatments/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="visible sun damage" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">visible sun damage</a>. They have more pronounced effects, but come with some downtime,” says Dr Williams, who adds that you can expect to experience flaking, tightness, and redness in the days that follow.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“(True) deep peels are mainly used to improve more severe skin conditions. They are often done in full anaesthesia, for example as part of a surgical face lift. An example of a deep peel agent is Phenol. I don’t endorse such peels, as they come with a much higher risk of complications. However, please note that often in layman’s language, medium-depth peels are referred to as 'deep', although strictly speaking they are not deep as per the traditional definition.”</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Which skin types can benefit from a chemical peel?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Many skin types can benefit from a chemical face peel – the trick is all in the depth chosen and the active ingredients used.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Superficial hydroxy-acid peels improve overall skin quality and texture, so are great for ageing skin and sun damage, but also for patients with comedones (blackheads and whiteheads) and a tendency for breakouts. This is because every single <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/skincare/a35596913/skinschgool-the-ultimate-guide-to-adult-acne/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=acne class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">acne</a> spot starts with a comedone (sometimes invisible to the naked eye, called micro-comedones), and clearing comedones with a chemical peel can help ‘starve’ the acne of its fuel. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/g33559587/best-salicylic-acid/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Salicylic acid" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Salicylic acid</a> peels can also be a useful acne-management adjunct, as they clear pores at an even deeper level.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Unlike acne types, people with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/skincare/news/a41594/beauty-glossary-what-is-rosacea/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=rosacea class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">rosacea</a> need to approach chemical peels with more caution.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Rosacea skin generally tends to be more sensitive and less oily compared to acne-prone skin, so we have to be a little more careful with peels in rosacea patients. They’re not generally contraindicated in rosacea skin, however we may choose a gentler version depending on the individual skin type and condition to avoid issues”</p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">How often should you have a chemical peel?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">According to Dr Williams, the answer to this depends largely on the depth of your peel. “While medium and deep peels are often a one-off session, superficial peels generally come as a course. To achieve the best results, a course of treatments (for example, four-to-six sessions at one-to-four week intervals, depending on the exact peel type and skin type) is often recommended for superficial peels.”</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=26 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">What is the downtime to expect after an in-clinic peel?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Again, your downtime will be determined by the depth and type of peel used. “With superficial peels, the treatment is quick and generally isn’t painful, although you might feel tingling or slight stinging with AHA peels; with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/skincare/a31278199/best-retinol-cream/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=retinol class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">retinol</a>-based peels you often don’t feel anything. You may be a little pink afterwards and in some cases experience mild flaking a couple of days later. But generally, there’s no significant downtime,” says Dr Williams.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Medium-depth peels involve more downtime than superficial peels. Redness, swelling, flaking and potentially some minor crusting may occur. The flaking often arrives with a delay of two-to-three days after treatment and is more pronounced compared to superficial peels,” she says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And finally, true deep peels are not for the faint-hearted. “Downtime is significant, with oozing and crusting, and risks are much higher than for all other types of peels, so I don’t routinely recommend these,” Dr Williams adds.</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for #SkinSchool: How to do an at-home facial" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/thumbnail-skin-school-facial-1585065638.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 data-node-id=31 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>What is the best chemical peel aftercare?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It goes without saying that skin requires gentle treatment following any kind of peel, so strip your skincare routine back and place any retinols, scrubs and exfoliating acids on hold. It’s also beneficial to avoid applying make-up the following day.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“After any peel, it’s essential to wear daily <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/skincare/g38180/best-face-spf/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="broad-spectrum sun protection" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">broad-spectrum sun protection</a> with SPF30 to 50 for around four months – if you don’t already do this as a matter of routine!” adds Dr Williams.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=35 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">How different are at-home chemical peels?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As we become more collectively confident in using chemical exfoliators, the industry has responded with plenty of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/skincare/a16570239/how-to-use-skincare-acids/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="at-home products" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">at-home products</a> using acids to mimic the effects of a traditional in-clinic peel – but can they really live up to their promises?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"At-home peels are very light chemical peels that are intended to be used safely at home, without the direction of a professional," explains Dr Brazzini.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"The depth of the peels depends on the substances in the formula, the concentrations and the PH," she explains – though all at-home peels will only work superficially. "Results are not even comparable to medical chemical peels, but they're a good maintenance solution if you can't get to a clinic," she adds. "Their main function is to deliver a nice glow and improve the skin texture." Think of them as an exfoliation treatment to remove dead cells from the skin surface.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">That's not to say that they shouldn't be taken very seriously. "I see a lot of patients who buy peels online and have nasty side effects, like minor burns," Dr Brazzini reveals. "Users must be very careful when buying at-home kits. I strongly recommend following a specialist's advise to avoid <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/skincare/a35242873/skin-barrier/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="damaging your skin" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">damaging your skin</a>, and always read the instructions on any packaging thoroughly to prevent any easy mistakes."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=40 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If you want to try a home peel for exfoliation, pore-clearing or to reduce oiliness, Dr Williams endorses the brand NeoStrata.
