That question is: Was that <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/tv-movies/1250903/sebastian-stan-penis/>Charles Melton’s penis</a> during that shocking sex scene?</p><p>May December is a drama-comedy directed by Todd Haynes and stars Julianne Moore, <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/celebrity-news/1623005/why-natalie-portman-husband-break-up/>Natalie Portman</a>, and Charles Melton. The movie follows Elizabeth Berry (Portman) as&nbsp;she shadows Gracie Atherton-Yoo (Moore) for a movie role based on Gracie’s scandal where she was caught having sex with 13-year-old Joe Yoo (Melton). The latter two end up marrying and have three kids more than 20 years later. With Elizabeth’s presence, the Atherton-Yoo family’s dynamic slowly changes after having bigger realizations.</p><p>When casting for the role, Haynes didn’t know of Melton’s Riverdale background and was enamored by his audition. “He’s just so glamorously handsome that it seemed to leap out of the movie,” the director told Netflix Tudum. “But his audition was remarkable. And I kept watching it over and over again. There was such restraint in it. There was such a sense of being <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/lists/singles-inferno-couples-still-together/>locked up</a> and unable to speak. Something that Charles understood about this character was ahead of me.”</p><p>During one of the climax scenes of the movie, Yoo is seduced by Berry and they end up having sex. After intercourse, Joe breaks down after Elizabeth says that he could still have a life without Gracie and refers to his life experiences as “stories.”</p><p>In one of his interviews, Charles Melton talked about the penis used in the sex scene. Here’s what he said.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=15.867330016584><h2>Was Charles Melton's penis real in May December?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/may-december.jpg><p>Charles Melton talked about the penis prosthetic in May December in conversation with <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://variety.com/2023/film/awards/charles-melton-may-december-prosthetic-nine-hours-1235822291/>Variety</a>. “It was very professional,” Melton recalled. “The whole thing. Natalie, Todd, and I met to discuss the scene, walking through it and ensuring everybody was comfortable. There were a few conversations about the prosthetic, regarding what was realistic and what wasn’t. And I had to wear that prosthetic for nine hours that day. I didn’t have anything to drink that morning or the night before. That was an annoying process but still very respectful.”</p><p>He talked about the breakdown after the scene to <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/charles-melton-may-december-interview rel=nofollow>Netflix Tudum</a>. “You see this child rising to the surface where there really wasn’t anything resolved,” Melton says. “Thinking about the scene after the sex scene with Elizabeth, Joe’s really looking at himself for the first time and musters that courage to ask the question we as the audience maybe are asking — and the question he’s never asked himself, which is ‘What if I wasn’t ready to be making those kinds of decisions?’</p><p>Body language is a crucial aspect of Joe’s character. “There’s so much pathos, so much going on,” Melton shared with Variety. “There’s this kind of repressed feeling. How they talk, it’s all right in the throat. For [playing] Joe, these words are forming for the first time. It’s like seeing somebody at a party hunched over, protected, and not trying to take up too much space. Joe doesn’t even know he’s doing it. It’s part of his adult child that has translated into the physicality of his movement which he’s not even aware. It’s just him existing.”</p><p>Melton’s portrayal turned eyes and garnered accolades like a Gotham Award for Best Supporting Actor and an New York Film Critics Circle Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor. He was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy. “Filming&nbsp;May December&nbsp;those 23 days in Georgia was my greatest experience in my profession as an actor, and there’s been so many things that have led up to that,” Melton said about the nomination. “I’m so grateful and trying to stay as grounded as possible and take things one day at a time. I love Julie, I love Natalie, I love Todd and Sammy. I love everybody that had a part in making this little movie.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=-2><h2>May December cast</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/may-december-.jpg><p>Here’s a list of the May December cast:</p><ul><li>Natalie Portman as Elizabeth</li><li>Julianne Moore as Gracie</li><li>Charles Melton as Joe Yoo</li><li>Cory Michael Smith as Georgie</li><li>Elizabeth Yu as Mary Atherton-Yoo</li><li>Gabriel Chung as Charlie Atherton-Yoo</li><li>Piper Curda as Honor Atherton-Yoo</li><li>D.
