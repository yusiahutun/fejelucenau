The overall theme of the song seems to center around rebellion, individuality, and a sense of invincibility. The artists express their disregard for societal norms and their determination to live life on their own terms. They assert their dominance and assert that they are not to be messed with.One standout lyric that helps develop this theme is in the very first verse by Juice WRLD: "Do whatever I want, don't give a fuck, live my life." This lyric reflects a sense of liberation and freedom from conforming to societal expectations. It conveys the idea of embracing one's true self, regardless of what others may think or say. It encourages listeners to prioritize their own desires and live life unapologetically.Another notable lyric is from YNW Melly's verse: "I ain't with the talkin', put the pussy nigga in a coffin." This line showcases a sense of power and dominance. It suggests that actions speak louder than words and that they are not afraid to take matters into their own hands. It reinforces the rebellious nature of the song and emphasizes the disregard for anything that may hold them back.Trippie Redd's verse includes several intriguing lyrics that contribute to the song's overall themes. One example is: "Diamonds on my fingers, baby blue, they look like Megamind." This line juxtaposes opulence and power with the character of Megamind, a supervillain from an animated film. It suggests that they are embracing their own unique version of power, even if it deviates from traditional conceptions.Another interesting line by Trippie Redd is: "I don't know reality, bitch, I feel like Coraline."

By referencing the movie "Coraline," which features a young girl entering an alternate reality, the lyric suggests a detachment from the norm and a willingness to explore the unknown. It conjures themes of escapism and the desire to transcend conventional boundaries.Lastly, Trippie Redd's lyric, "Cause we live that fucking triple six life, yeah, that 6 kiss life" adds a dark and mysterious element to the song. It alludes to the number of the beast and satanic symbolism. This could be interpreted as a metaphorical expression of a rebellious, chaotic lifestyle that defies societal expectations. It portrays the artists as individuals who fully embrace their own darkness and are unapologetic about it.In conclusion, '6 Kiss' by Juice WRLD is a song that delves into themes of rebellion, individuality, and a sense of invincibility.
