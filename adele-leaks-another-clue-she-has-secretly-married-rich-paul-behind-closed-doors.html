I’m straight, my love, and my husband’s here tonight,” she responded. When asked by the fan if she could ‘try’, the singer jokingly responded: “No, I don’t want to try. I’m with Rich. You’re crazy, leave me alone.”</p><p>Rich then <a href=#>broke his silence</a> on the matter a few weeks later, however, fans were still as in the dark as ever. Now, they’ve spotted a big clue on her Instagram.</p><p>Showcasing weekend number 31, on the gram, like she does every week, the star posted a photo holding her partner’s new book, with a huge giant, square, diamond ring on her finger.</p><p>In the photo, she’s holding up Rich’s book, covering half her face as she stuns in a black gown. However, all eyes were on her hands.</p><p>It’s not the first time the 35-year-old has been spotted with a rock on her finger during her relationship with Paul.</p><p>At the start of 2022, she was also spotted with a ring on her finger.
