Tyler Goodjohn started out as a boxer, but quit the traditional sport to embrace the fast-growing movement around bare knuckle fighting.
Brutal bouts see fighters face off without gloves, often sustaining shocking facial injuries and swollen fists as they go head-to-head in a squared ring."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I would be just constantly chasing that high,” he explained.</p><p>In fact, Tyler suggested that addiction issues – whether alcohol, drugs or sex – had been an issue for many of his peers in the fighting world as they approached the end of their careers.</p><p>“I don’t know if it’s because we're used to always fighting, and having that high of fighting, and now we can see that we’re probably coming towards the end of it,” he added.</p><p>And now, having stopped shooting porn, Tyler was able to reflect on the impact that the career switch had left on his fighting, including the inevitable online trolling that comes from being associated to adult work.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><p>He recalled: “As a fighter, all my trolls were sending me videos of her porn and all that.. But six or seven months down the line, I don’t know what it was but it clicked and I was alright with it.</p><p>“But it definitely desensitises your mind to sex, because I’d been round so many studios and seen how fake porn is. Even now I can’t really watch it because it’s so fake.”</p><p>Although Tyler has moved on from his time working in porn, he admitted that he is still battling his sex addiciton issues.</p><p>But, looking ahead, he told James that he has aspirations to become world champion of his weight class “in the next year”.</p><p><b><i>To get more sport stories from Daily Star delivered straight to your inbox sign up to one of our free newsletters </i></b><a href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=section><b><i><u>here</u></i></b></a><b><i>.</i></b></p><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><ul><li data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=26286815><a class="embed-image hidden" href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index3|Image aria-label="Bareknuckle fighters stage bizarre Russia v Ukraine bout on war-torn border amid gunfire" data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=26286815><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article26460573.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_4JPG.jpg></a> <a href=# data-image=https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article26286916.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_Bareknuckle-fighters-stage-Russia-v-Ukraine-bout-on-war-torn-border-as-guns-fire-in-background.jpg data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index3|text data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=26286815>Bareknuckle fighters stage bizarre Russia v Ukraine bout on war-torn border amid gunfire</a><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png alt=dailystar style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></li></ul><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><ul><li data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=26272769><a class="embed-image hidden" href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index4|Image aria-label='Ex-UFC star threatens "little b****" rival by pulling out bat during ugly war of words' data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=26272769><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article26460581.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_2JPG.jpg></a> <a href=# data-image=https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article26272729.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/2_JS258209112.jpg data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index4|text data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=26272769>Ex-UFC star threatens "little b****" rival by pulling out bat during ugly war of words</a><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png alt=dailystar style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKugpL%2B1e86tn56qXai9sL7TrGabmaKaeqy61JyipZ1dqLK5ecCdm6KbpJ68r3nPqKmnZWJrgXd8lGpp</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
