It is the latest in a string of high-profile events the government has seized upon to convey to the rest of the world that Hong Kong has emerged from its Covid-19 isolation.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One of the topics of discussion this year is Hong Kong’s future as an international hub for dispute resolution, a role that Beijing laid down in its latest five-year blueprint for the nation.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Founded in 1893, the Hague Conference on International Private Law boasts 90 member states and 65 non-members, who are at least a signatory to one of its more than 40 conventions.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The group defines ways for members to work together on a range of private and commercial legal matters by adopting a common approach, for instance a universally accepted view on recognition of judgments.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Hong Kong welcomes overseas experts at high-level law forum</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The office, now located in the French Mission Building in Central previously home to the Court of Final Appeal, is staffed by a member of the Hong Kong Department of Justice, an employee from China’s foreign ministry department and Zhao Yun, a legal scholar from the University of Hong Kong. They are committed to a part-time basis.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Bernasconi said that while the legal body has never received “voices that have questioned the creation” of its Hong Kong branch, making it less reliant on the financial support of the two governments would be beneficial in the long run. However, he acknowledged the process would take time due to limited resources.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I think that would give us a sound basis to attract representatives from the wider region to make the office even more inclusive,” the secretary general said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Bernasconi noted the city offered well-educated legal professionals, an efficient legal system and easy access to other regions, which was essential to promoting the group’s presence, organising training and monitoring implementation of its conventions.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Hong Kong has been extremely generous and active in organising and inviting us regularly to events like this and to showcase and promote our work. China is a very active member of the organisation,” he said. “There is no intention to move the office.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Hong Kong to ‘boost legal know-how of residents’ in response to 2019 protests</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">During a speech at the legal event on Tuesday, Liu Guangyuan, commissioner of China’s foreign ministry office in Hong Kong, made a pledge to support the office.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Liu said the city had entered a “new chapter of good governance” following the implementation of the national security law drafted by Beijing, adding: “We have much to contribute and gain.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Post has reached out to the department for details on the funding for the office.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A report detailing the establishment of the Hong Kong office in 2012 showed Australia contributed €40,000 at the time, while Beijing undertook to pay no less than €460,000 over three years.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hong Kong Secretary for Justice Paul Lam Ting-kwok told the same event an increasingly connected world made the legal body’s commitment to multilateralism more relevant than ever, and that his department had worked with the Hong Kong office to strengthen ties with regional bodies, including the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0mifqKaXYriwusZoo5qvXZa7pXnCq6CmnV%2BWv7W1wqWcaGthboV6fphoo56fkaF6tMDAp5uaqpRiwKbA06KloGWSpLG6edKasKxlmKS7qHnKqKWgZaKauqK1zaxkopyVlrlutM6sq2aZo56ubrzAnKCfoZNivKeyyJycZqiclru0edSnm56qXayuug%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
