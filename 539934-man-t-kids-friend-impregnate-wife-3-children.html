I had tried to impregnate other women in the hope that he could have kids, but it was never productive. That was when I reached out to my best friend," Patrick said.<p class=align-left>When Patrick's friend got the news, he was surprised and unsure about his best friend's decision with his wife.</p><h2>Our bonds remain unshaken, Patrick</h2><p class=align-left>Zubeda admitted she was not up for the idea as she instantly declined, but seeing her husband was unhappy, she faintly accepted.</p>"Patrick asked for a big favour. I hesitated but agreed to help. I fathered three children, but we agreed they would be his. I do not consider those children to be mine, and we made some agreements confirming that.
