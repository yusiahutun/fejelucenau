In addition to being a band on the show, BTR also signed with the Columbia/Epic Label Group as musicians. Big Time Rush is Kendall Schmidt (Kendall Knight – the reluctant “leader”), James Maslow (James Diamond – the “hot” one), Logan Henderson (Logan Mitchell – the “smart” one) and Carlos PenaVega (Carlos Garcia – the “funny” one), as they were portrayed during the show’s 74-episode run. Big Time Rush was one of the longest running live-action TV series in the history of Nickelodeon.</p><p>The boyband released three albums (BTR, Elevate and 24/Seven), a 2-song Holiday Bundle and embarked on five tours from 2009 until 2013. BTR debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200 and was certified Gold, Elevate debuted at number 12, selling more units than their debut and 24/Seven was released on June 11, 2013. Their most successful single “Boyfriend”, peaked at number 72 on the Billboard Hot 100. In addition, they starred in the TV movie, Big Time Movie, where the boys were in London scheduled to perform live but instead ended up saving the world.</p><p>By 2013, the boys amicably decided to go their own ways. Maslow reached fourth place on Season 18 of Dancing with the Stars and was the sixth runner-up in the first US version of Celebrity Big Brother, Henderson took a 3-year hiatus to focus on his personal life and released his debut album Echoes of Departure and the Endless Street of Dreams – Pt. 1 in 2018. The first single, “Pull Me Deep” peaked at number 40 on the Billboard Mainstream Top 40. Schmidt went on to perform in his band Heffron Drive through his own label, TOLBooth Records, and PenaVega voices Bobby Santiago in the animated series’ The Loud House and its spin-off, The Casagrandes. In addition, he settled down marrying Spy Kids’ actress Alexa Vega (they combined last names and officially go by PenaVega) and has three children.</p><p>BTR announced in December 2021 they were reuniting for two shows with all four members. The shows, December 15 at the Chicago Theater and December 18 at the Hammerstein Ballroom in New York were both sold-out. Those shows just weren’t enough as Monday (February 21), the boys in the band announced the full-pledged, 41-date “Forever” tour on Good Morning America (GMA). “We’re officially back and going on tour”, they announced before performing their new single, “Not Giving You Up” live from the GMA stage. BTR will be releasing new music in 2022, for the first time in eight years.</p><p>“Rushers” as BTR’s fans are known as, took to social media to express their excitement over the announcement (boy band fans aren’t known for their subtlety). One fan wrote, “Tell me this is actually for real and not someone who hacked the account”, BTR responded in kind with “Oh, it’s real!” It appears as if the band AND the Rushers are excited for the reunions to come.</p><p>Tickets go on sale Friday, February 25 for all shows.
