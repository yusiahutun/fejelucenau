So it might be that when you taste caffeine, you have learned to link that to the stimulant effects of caffeine.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In other words, the desire for the stimulant effects of caffeine is so strong, we are willing to seek out a bitter taste to get it.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">That stimulant-seeking behaviour is controlled by different genetic variants – those that control the body’s ability to metabolise caffeine. If your genes are programmed to metabolise caffeine efficiently, you will burn through its stimulant effect more quickly, which is why you’ll spend more time at the office coffee pot than colleagues. “We are all sort of constantly titrating our own caffeine levels,” says Cornelis.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/11/29/5d98ad4c-f2f6-11e8-bbe8-afaa0960a632_1320x770_134408.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She and other researchers have identified about eight genetic variants that act on metabolism of caffeine and can predict consumption levels. Studying caffeine and genetics may one day unlock some of the mysteries of caffeine’s protective effects on general health and diseases such as diabetes and heart disease.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Large-scale studies have shown a link between lifespan and coffee consumption – people who drink around four cups per day live longer, and as scientists work to understand those effects, they may be able to harness that knowledge to combat disease.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Turmeric: the wonder food that should be every Hongkonger’s cup of tea</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The genetic link to bitter tastes has also been studied. Scientists have shown that ‘super tasters’, who have more taste buds and taste everything more vividly than the rest of us, tend to avoid strong spices and have a stronger aversion to bitter. On the other hand, there are a few outliers who express a true like for bitter tastes (versus a learned tolerance).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/11/29/37c2c486-f2f6-11e8-bbe8-afaa0960a632_600x_134408.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Correlations have been shown between this affinity for bitter tastes and “malevolent traits associated with a psychopathic personality, particularly the characteristic known as ‘everyday sadism,’” writes Brown University neuroscientist Rachel Herz.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Herz’s book Why You Eat What You Eat explores the intersection of science and eating habits, and points out that enjoyment of bitter tastes has implications for drinking and vulnerability to alcoholism.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A study at Indiana University showed that beer drinkers experienced dopamine release that mimics the feeling of being intoxicated after tasting a bitter taste like beer. It’s a classic Pavlovian response: transferring the response to beer onto a simple taste signal. Study participants with a family history of alcoholism experienced even greater dopamine release from the bitter taste, signalling a genetic predisposition to expect reward from bitter tastes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/11/29/7347c0ce-f2f6-11e8-bbe8-afaa0960a632_972x_134408.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Most of us who are lining up for coffee, however, don’t have an affinity for bitter tastes. Part of the draw to the coffee shop can be explained by cultural and even meteorological considerations – people in cold-weather climates tend to drink more coffee.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Why Hongkongers prefer to drink hot water, whatever the weather</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chicago, poster city for cold winters, has always been a big consumer of coffee (it was home to Starbucks’ first expansion store back in 1987), and that’s nothing compared with places like Finland, where coffee consumption per capita is about twice that of the US.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But Cornelis (who never drank coffee until she moved to Chicago) says her research simply shows that those who are sensitive to the taste of caffeine are naturally attuned to finding it, in an effort to get that little extra burst of energy. They still may like the taste of something sugary better – which brings us back to the coffee shop.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/11/29/4c2f1fa0-f2f6-11e8-bbe8-afaa0960a632_1320x770_134408.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The genius of Starbucks, says Cornelis, isn’t that it is perfectly positioned to take advantage of human genetics or aeons of learned experience. “Where Starbucks is really keyed in,” she says, “is that the bitterness of coffee can be easily masked. So they’re always coming out with a new drink, a new flavour.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The caffeine is what we’re all after, but for most of us, there’s only one question that matters, she says: “It’s all about ‘What else do you want in your drink?’”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLWmrcutn2avlaG5r7HSrGaaqqSesK2xjmtocG1lbIBwr86fnZ6dXZa7pXnOrqlmpJ%2BrsnC0wK2cZqqVoa61tc6nqqGhoGKvqsDTnqmnnaOo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
