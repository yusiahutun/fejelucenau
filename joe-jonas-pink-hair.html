We can’t really know why the new dad decided to switch up his hair but he did put a breast cancer awareness ribbon on his Instagram story so it’s possible he did it to honor the month—or it was just a nice coincidence. Either way, it’s all about pink right now, especially during October.</p><p>Jonas shared another even more important photo of his new <a href=#>pink hair</a>, this time to his grid. He captioned the photo #ivoted and showed off his voting sticker. Jonas and his wife Sophie Tuner recently welcomed their daughter, Willa, and have been keeping it low key. But Jonas knows how important it is to share that <a href=#>you voted</a> and to encourage others to make sure their voice is heard as well.</p><p>If you’re voting by mail and are bummed you aren’t getting a sticker (just me?), there’s a ton of <a href=#>cool merch</a> to rock this election. There are <a href=#>Biden/Harris tees</a> and sweatshirts, <a href=#>Ruth Bader Ginsburg face masks</a> and so many more ways to show your support. Whether you want to do it with pink hair is up to you. Take inspo from <a href=#>Kaia Gerber</a>, <a href=#>Faith Hill</a> and her daughter, as well as <a href=#>Dua Lipa</a> to find the cool pink hue for you. Or maybe it makes more sense to go blue for election day. <a href=#>Hilary Duff’s blue bob</a> is a good place to start.</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/banner-newsletter-beauty_july2020.jpg alt="STYLECASTER | Ashley Benson Interview" width=670 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLWitdFmpZqhnKh8cn2VbWhpal%2BfvKZ5yailmqtdpbavt4yhmKKqXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
