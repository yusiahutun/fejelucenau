The Jennifer's Body actor and her fiancé Machine Gun Kelly attended Drake's Super Bowl party in Scottsdale, Arizona, last night, where they wore their signature edgy couple style. For the bash, Fox wore an all-black look comprised of a plunging strapless bodysuit and high-waisted wide-leg trousers. The outfit was elevated by several cutouts, including a trio of midriff openings under the suit's deep neckline, and large skin-baring circles at each hip."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Following the awards, Fox shared a heartfelt tribute on Instagram, paired with a pic of the couple in their jewel-adorned red-carpet looks.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Congratulations on being in the very small percentage of artists who have received a Grammy nomination," she wrote to Kelly. "You have handled this process with a grace and maturity that I haven’t seen from you before and I’m so proud of you. Watching you walk in humility and gratitude, watching you grow into yourself and become a better man is an immeasurably more satisfying experience than watching you accept an award."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Although those will come… and this is irrelevant I guess but I will just never ever get over how beautiful your face is.
