Princess Eugenie, daughter of Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York and Prince Andrew, walked down the aisle towards her now husband in 2018. The royal celebration saw Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank exchange vows at St George’s Chapel in a grand ceremony. It happened shortly after Meghan Markle and Harry’s own wedding in spring that year."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The <a href=#>royal</a> celebration saw Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank exchange vows at St George’s Chapel in a grand ceremony. It happened shortly after <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> and Harry’s own wedding in spring that year. Hundreds of guests were invited for the special day. But one empty seat at the front of the chapel was left completely empty – it’s because of an old tradition by The Firm.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-princess-eugenie-s-royal-wedding-had-a-single-empty-seat-at-the-front>Princess Eugenie’s royal wedding had a single empty seat at the front</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/10/GettyImages-1051961384-1024x640.jpg><p>The joyous occasion saw a celebrity-filled guest list, including Take That singer Robbie Williams and model Cara Delevigne. Of course, senior royals were in attendance, including <a href=#>Queen Elizabeth II</a> and Prince Philip.</p><p>Despite the 850 guests and packed chapel, there was an empty seat in the front row of the <a href=#>royal wedding.</a></p><p>Photographs from the big day show a prime seat with a great view completely empty, next to Prince Andrew, Eugenie’s dad.</p><p>But the empty seat wasn’t because of a no-show or last-minute cancellation from a guest. It was because of the Queen. Traditionally, the monarch and senior royals site on the right-hand side of the quire in the building.</p><p>But the late Queen actually preferred the second row of seats, reportedly finding the front too uncomfortable. Due to the tradition of no person being allowed to sit in front of the Queen – or her view would be obstructed – the seat in front has to be left empty.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-royal-tradition-is-always-followed>Royal tradition is always followed</h2><p>Another instance of the same seat being empty was for <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> and Meghan’s wedding in the same chapel. Also, when a service was conducted for the Queen when she passed away last year, there was another empty space in the front row in front of the now <a href=#>King Charles</a>.</p><p>Even though the empty seat had a reason behind it, there was a missing guest at the wedding.</p><p><a href=#>Queen Consort Camilla</a> wasn’t there on the day, instead, she had a royal engagement in Scotland. Camilla was attending a school harvest festival, which she had agreed to attend before Eugenie announced her wedding date.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-other-bizarre-royal-rules-that-are-rarely-broken>Other bizarre royal rules that are rarely broken</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/10/GettyImages-1051951084-1024x740.jpg><p>There is a long list of rules The Firm follow, and some of them make more sense than others.</p><p>One of the most serious traditions is something which prevents <a href=#>Prince William</a>, Kate Middleton and their children flying together. It’s forbidden for two heirs to the British throne to travel in the same way. This is in case of a tragedy or natural disaster were to occur. Therefore, <a href=#>Prince William and his son, George</a> (second in lie to the throne) aren’t permitted to fly or be on the same train together. Instead, they have to travel separately.</p><p>Another rule is that no royal can sign an autograph or write their name for someone who asks for it. <a href=#>Kate Middleton was recently put in an awkward situation</a> when a young child asked for hers. But she had to deny the simple request.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpoX2aAcL7OspilZaeasaW1zaCqZp2dpcG6edKemK1lp5bAbrjEn6tmmpGnsm7AzmaqraGToHq1u4yipKmnoqmur8CMramanJmptrC6jg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
