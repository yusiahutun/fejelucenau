The financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed. The merger brings together two companies that have been doing business under the same brand name, but under different ownership, for more than 25 years.</p><p>"The completion of this transaction brings our long-time UK partners into the Rock-It Cargo Holdings family," said David Bernstein, chairman and CEO of Rock-It Cargo Holdings LLC. "This is a wonderful culmination of years of working closely together. This consolidation is a continuation of Rock-It Cargo's strategy of actively seeking talented people and firms in the logistics community to join Rock-It Cargo Holdings and its worldwide network of affiliates. Rock-It Cargo is currently looking at several additional strategic acquisitions."</p><p>Chris Wright founded Rock-It Cargo UK in 1978 with the mission to become the leading freight service provider in the live entertainment industry. Growing to three continents with additional companies in the USA (1982) and Japan (1983), the Rock-It Cargo brand quickly realized its goal. Over the past 28 years, the Rock-It Cargo companies have dominated freight forwarding and logistics for live events around the world.</p><p>"The merger of our businesses is the natural next step for our organization," said Wright, who will remain managing director of the UK operation. "Both Rock-It Cargo UK and Rock-It Cargo Holdings have been growing into other industries that need time-sensitive, high-service freight forwarding and logistics. The trade show, heavy industrial, and fine arts industries need the type of specialized services that both of our companies can provide. By joining together, we can leverage our joint resources and grow even more quickly than before. We're very excited to help create this expanded incarnation of Rock-It Cargo. –Bob Grossweiner and Jane Cohen</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaJuRlr%2BktMivnGiqn5i4brXTZpqaqpekeqm7y52gp5%2BjYq6kvdSiqZ6rXae8pLeMoqtmm5GntLB5y6KkoqyVmXw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
