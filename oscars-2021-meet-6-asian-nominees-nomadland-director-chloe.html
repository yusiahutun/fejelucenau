In the running: best supporting actress for Minari
She’s the first South Korean actress to be nominated for an Oscar, a Bafta, a Critics’ Choice Movie Award and two Screen Actors Guild (SAG) Awards – the latter three of which she won. The 73-year-old Youn Yuh-jung made her acting debut in 1967, after passing an acting audition held by a local broadcasting company. However, her breakthrough moment – in an illustrious career spanning over 50 years – came four years later in 1971, when she won awards for her role as a femme fatale in the film Woman of Fire."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

In a testament to her talent and charm, Youn beat the odds in a youth-obsessed society by pulling off a stellar comeback despite her age and the stigma attached to divorcees.</p>To this day, she continues to land significant roles in films and TV shows, such as the upcoming Apple TV+ adaptation of Pachinko.

The following year, in 2014, he got his big break co-starring alongside Jake Gyllenhaal in Nightcrawler.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">That said, most of you will probably recognise Ahmed from his roles in Jason Bourne (Aaron Kalloor) and Rogue One (Bodhi Rook). Besides acting, he’s also a respected solo musician with his own record label, a member of the hip-hop group Swet Shop Boys and a producer of two chart-topping albums.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Recently, Ahmed married bestselling novelist Fatima Farheen Mirza in a low-key, socially distanced wedding ceremony.

Though we don’t foresee his acting career stalling after this, he has his stake in The Bun Shop, a Korean-Mediterranean fusion restaurant in LA’s Koreatown, to fall back on.

While the Korean-American director’s debut feature, Munyurangabo, was an official selection at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival, his subsequent efforts hovered just below mainstream radar till Minari came along.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The semi-autobiographical film is based on Chung’s experience as a child of South Korean immigrants trying to make it in rural America. He’s officially made it, just perhaps not in the way most Asian parents imagine. Chung is an alumnus of the United States Senate Youth Program and studied biology at Yale before dropping out in his last year to pursue filmmaking.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Despite controversy over whether Minari should be categorised as a foreign language film at the Golden Globe Awards, it went on to win in this category.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Derek Tsang</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the running: best international feature film for Better Days</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/04/01/2336b230-c8e4-41f1-a0ab-871c82ecdbec_d7491f3d.jpg>We never thought veteran comedian, actor and TVB executive Eric Tsang would ever be associated with the Oscars – but the day has come <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">through his son Derek Tsang</span></a>.
