Though I cover loads of beauty products each week, to be completely honest, I’m not a huge fan of wearing makeup.

I prefer to let my skin breathe and can’t stand makeup stains on my face masks. I’ll only apply <a href=# id=auto-tag_foundation data-tag=foundation>foundation</a> and other base makeup when I have a special event or occasion. With that said, there’s one product that has changed my perspective and now gets me excited to put on foundation rather than dreading a cakey face that doesn’t really look or feel like my natural skin anymore.</span></p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/anua-heartleaf-toner-tiktok.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/beauty-of-joseon-fi.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span>The Minimalist from <a href=# id=auto-tag_merit-beauty data-tag=merit-beauty>Merit Beauty</a></span></a><span> is my new fave foundation and it relaunched in November 2022, coming back better (and bigger) than ever. This 2-in-1 foundation and <a href=# id=auto-tag_concealer data-tag=concealer>concealer</a> stick now contains twice the amount of product for the same price tag of $38. Nothing about the formula has changed; it’s still just as creamy, weightless and buildable. I love how the foundation feels like my second skin every time I apply it.</span></p><p><span>You might be new to </span><a rel="noopener nofollow" href=#><span>Merit Beauty</span></a><span>, but I’m nowhere close to the only </span><a rel="noopener nofollow" href=#><span>The Minimalist</span></a><span> stan. Besides Ashley Tisdale using this stick in her </span><a rel="noopener nofollow" href=#><span>Beauty Secrets video with Vogue</span></a><span>, Lola Tung applying it in her <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>GRWM with Vogue</a>, and Kaitlyn Dever wearing it to a <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Vanity Fair after party</a>, the brand’s best-seller once garnered over 10,000 shoppers on a waitlist. I can tell you that the wait for this restock and relaunch was not easy. I was constantly checking the site (and </span><a rel="noopener nofollow" href=#><span>Sephora</span></a><span>) for my shade to become available again—it’s become that much of an essential in my makeup bag!</span></p><p><span>Now that </span><a rel="noopener nofollow" href=#><span>The Minimalist</span></a><span> has been back (and packed with even more product), it’s safe to say the wait was well worth it.</span> <span>Keep reading to learn why thousands like me lined up to stock up on this cult-favorite product—and why you should, too</span>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/the-minimalist-merit-beauty.jpg><p><span>Let’s start with the shade range: Pick from 20 colors that melt right into your skin to give you a flawless, barely-there finish. The model shots and product swatches on the site are super helpful for choosing your perfect shade, and there’s also a shade finder feature. If you’re trying to channel your inner “clean girl” or create a <a rel=noopener href=#>no-makeup makeup look</a>, </span><a rel="noopener nofollow" href=#><span>Merit Beauty</span></a><span> as a whole is your new go-to, but this foundation and concealer hybrid is a true standout.</span> So is the brand’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>makeup brush</a>. I tried blending The Minimalist in with a non-Merit brush and could tell the difference immediately. Brush No.1 blended the foundation in much easier and more smoothly. It quickly became an essential in my <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Signature Bag</a>.</p><p><span>The full-coverage foundation I was using before I discovered The Minimalist made me feel like I was applying a whole new layer of skin rather than accentuating my natural complexion. Merit takes a minimalist beauty approach with “less is more” as its motto, and after trying the creamy formula and several of its other offerings, I can confirm that the brand fits the bill.</span></p><p><span>The </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span>foundation</span></a><span> leaves your complexion dewy and natural-looking without emphasizing fine lines or drying out your skin. Plus, you can build the coverage from light to medium without it feeling heavy.</span></p><p><span>What makes The Minimalist so hydrating? It’s skin-loving ingredients, of course! Sea daffodil extract minimizes the appearance of hyperpigmentation and dark spots, while </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span>fatty acids</span></a><span> moisturize dry areas. Even better, it doesn’t contain acne-triggering additives, so you’ll remain spot-free after wear.</span></p><p><span>This fan-favorite product already doubles as a foundation and concealer, but if you want to take things a step further, order <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Minimalist</a> in a color that’s three shades deeper than your go-to and use it to contour your face.</span></p><p><span>Whether you want a full face of foundation and concealer, to cover blemishes, to erase under-eye dark circles or to achieve a killer contour, this easy-to-use stick gets the job done every single time and in many different ways.</span></p><p><span>Plus, the product packaging is made from 43 percent recycled plastic, following </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span>the brand’s goal to incorporate sustainability</span></a><span> in its offerings. When you’re in a rush and simply can’t be bothered, simply swipe on the creamy formula and you’re good to go. The twist-up stick is also mess-free since it’s not a liquid foundation. We love intentional, practical packaging that makes life so much easier!</span></p><p><span>Like me, shoppers are also quick to praise this multitasking makeup product.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“</span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span>The Minimalist</span></a><span> is oh so so handy. I can just run it across my face and call it a day,” raved one five-star shopper. “The pigmentation is so nice. It’s just perfect. I love the finished result and its ability to conceal and correct my small little imperfections.”</span></p><p><span>“LOOOOOVVVVED IT!! It’s perfect for me on days that I want my natural skin to shine and I need to just cover quick blemishes, my redness and my under eyes,” wrote another reviewer. “Blends soooo easy and leaves your skin looking like skin!”</span></p><p><span>Well, makeup lovers near and far, that’s a wrap on </span><a rel="noopener nofollow" href=#><span>Merit Beauty’s The Minimalist</span></a><span>. It’s clear as day why this foundation-concealer-bronzer stick needs to be in your beauty routine ASAP. And don’t forget that there’s 1.7 times more product in this new iteration—and the price is still the same—so you truly are hitting the jackpot. I promise it’ll be money well spent and your new fave makeup product.</span></p><p>If you <a href=# id=auto-tag_shop data-tag=shop>shop</a> The Minimalist and Brush No.1, your cart will reach $40+, which means you’ll receive a complimentary <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Merit Signature Bag</a> with your order. It’s the chicest pouch I’ve ever laid eyes on and holds all of my beautifully-packaged Merit products with the simple tie of a knot.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLqit8Sup2hpYmyFd4SSaKSeqpmpeqOxwK6rsmWknbJuucinoKaZnJ7AtXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
