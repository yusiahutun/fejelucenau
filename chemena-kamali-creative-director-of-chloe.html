She will present her first pre-collection in Paris in January 2024, following Gabriela Hearst's departure from the Maison. For months, it has been rumored that Kamali would take the top spot at Chloé, having begun her career at the label working on Phoebe Philo's team and later as Design Director for Clare Waight Keller in 2013. Beginning in 2016, she was Design Director for Anthony Vaccarello at Saint Laurent.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As Kamali wrote in a statement issued by Richemont this morning, "My heart has always been Chloé's. It has been since I stepped through its doors more than 20 years ago." She added, "Returning feels natural and very personal. I am extremely honored to be taking on this role and to be building on the vision that Gaby Aghion and Karl Lagerfeld defined early in the Maison's history. I hope to capture the emotional connection and spirit of Chloé for today."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">President and CEO of the Maison Riccardo Bellini echoed Kamali's sentiments about coming back to Chloé, explaining that "Chemena's vision, inspired by her love for the brand, will truly celebrate Chloé's unique DNA. Chemena is both the Creative Director of Chloé and the embodiment of the Chloé spirit. I am excited to see her vision come to life."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Indeed, her appointment will be one to watch, especially considering that it comes at a time when there is important discourse happening around the lack of women in positions of power within the fashion industry (both creatively and business-wise). With a strong background and a deep history within the Maison, it will be exciting to watch Kamali's vision come to life in January.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfm660tMiopWiclai2qLrEq6pomWRqgXl%2Bj2lwaJuYmrqmusBmopqlkaG2bq%2FRnpitoaaaeqW10Z6araeiYrynecKho6idXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
