But nothing prepared her for the constant glam time that comes with being an actress. "I literally spend about two hours every single day in the hair and makeup chair," she says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In episode three of Chopra's BAZAAR series Little Black Book, she let's us follow along as she gets her hair and makeup done for the 2018 Met Gala. Chopra works with makeup artist Pati Dubroff, whose other clients include Margot Robbie and Natalie Portman. "Whatever problems I might be having on my skin, Pati knows how to take care of it," notes Chopra.</p><h5 class="css-1qq1axs e1ghppmw6"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Shop Priyanka's Beauty Look<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h5><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Dubroff is a master at prepping skin before makeup. First, she starts with the 111Skin sheet masks. "They give this incredible plump glow, and they just feel good," notes the makeup artist. Chopra adds: "It was cold as hell. She put it on my face and I literally screamed."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After peeling off the mask, Dubroff likes to massage Chopra's face with a roller. "These are Japanese face tools and they help to stimulate circulation and move fluids around," she says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But it's Dubroff's moisturizer trick that might be the biggest game-changer."Moisturizer is important but you don't put it everywhere," she says. Dubroff only pats moisturizer on where Chopra needs it—the outer edges of her face—then uses a mattifying primer along the t-zone and center.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There is one feature Chopra won't let Dubroff touch: her eyebrows. The actress prefers to do them herself. "I change my eyebrows according to whatever character I want," she says. "You can absolutely change what your face looks like with what you do with your eyebrows."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Chopra loves makeup, but hair wasn't always her thing. "My hair was my biggest problem. It went from being my biggest problem to my crowning glory," she notes. The actress, who works with Pantene as an ambassador, believes good hair starts in the shower. "It's so important to find the right shampoo and conditioner for your hair. Deep mask, twice a week, at least. I love oiling my hair with coconut oil for the scalp. It allows for circulation which is amazing," she says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Watch the video above to learn more about Chopra's journey to love her hair, and why bangs might just be her next adventurous haircut.

While attending NYU, she held internships at Women’s Wear Daily, Bloomingdale’s, Harper’s BAZAAR, and Allure, the latter of which she parlayed into her first job as the Beauty Assistant. She left Allure three years later as the Senior Beauty Editor. She spent a few months at Refinery29 overseeing branded content in the same title, before finally landing back at BAZAAR to manage all beauty content. When she's not testing every lipstick known to mankind, getting zapped by new lasers, or interviewing experts and celebrities, you can find Rosenstein at home in New Jersey with her son, husband, and black cat named Maddie.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfl7KiwdOyZqaZm5rCsXvAa2hyb2JpgXl7z6ugspmeoK5ur8eop6uZXZ2uqr6MppiknaWlerO71K2gp51f</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
