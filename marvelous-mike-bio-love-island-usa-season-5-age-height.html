However, Mike’s entry to the Fiji villa didn’t arrive until several episodes into the show.</span></p><p>Since fans could set up a date between the bombshell and a fellow contestant, fans already seemed biased towards setting Mike up with <a href=#>Vickala ‘Kay Kay’ Gray</a>. Before his arrival, Vikala was close to Keenan Anumay, who ultimately lost interest in her.</p><p>One of the social media users wrote, “Mike better be going on a date with my girl Kay Kay I know that.”</p><p>“I’m sorry, but Keenan and Kaykay need a damn break!

This reflects in his Instagram which is devoid of photos of his family.</p><p>However, Mike doesn’t seem to shy away from uploading videos/pictures with his nephew, Ayden. Not only is Ayden Mike’s best friend, but he is also his gym partner. Ayden has appeared in a couple of Mike’s workout videos on Instagram.</p><p>Ayden, based on Mike’s IG post, was reportedly born in 2016.

You’re destined for greatness, it runs in the family.”</p><h3><strong>Marvelous Mike Height</strong></h3><p>At 21, Marvelous Mike measured 6’3” in height. 2 years before that, he was only 6 feet tall.</p><p>Up until his teenage years, Mike hated his body, despite training 5-7 times a week, often 2-3 a day. Reflecting on the <a href=#>dark times</a>, Mike shared, “I thought something was wrong with me because all the kids who didn’t train as hard as me & eat as much as me still were bigger and stronger than me”</p><p>“To make things worse I started consuming a lot of fitness content online (which isn’t necessarily a bad thing.) Until I started to compare myself to professional fitness models,” Mike continued.</p><p>With self-love and the pursuit of fitness for the right reasons, Mike overcame the hurdle.</p><h3><strong>Marvelous Mike Job</strong></h3><p>Marvelous Mike dons several hats — fitness trainer, fashion model, entrepreneur, and social media star.</p><p>According to Meaww.com, Mike has modeled for Edge Lifestyle.

By Aug 2023, he had 260 followers on his TikTok profile @marvelousmike.</p><p>Relatively a successful figure, Mike has already bought his dream car bought from money from the Internet.
