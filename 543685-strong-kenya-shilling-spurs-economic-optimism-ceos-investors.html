It exchanged at KSh 131.17 per US dollar on April 4 compared to KSh 131.80 per US dollar on March 28" wrote the CBK in the weekly bulletin.<p class=align-left>According to the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">CBK,</a> the <a href=#>US dollar</a> traded at KSh 130.7443, the Sterling pound at KSh 165.7119, and the EURO at KSh 142.1060 as of Friday, March 5.</p><h2>Why the shilling is steady against the US dollar</h2><p class=align-left>At its April 3, 2024 meeting, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to maintain the Central Bank Rate (CBR) at 13.0%.</p><p class=align-left>The MPC observed that previous measures had successfully mitigated inflation, alleviated exchange rate pressures, and stabilised inflationary expectations.</p><p class=align-left>Speaking to TUKO.co.ke Daniel Kathali, an economist and lecturer at Mt. Kenya University, noted that the inflow of the US dollars from the recently issued Eurobond may have increased the supply of dollars in the market, thus reducing pressure on the shilling.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9bc069fb92fe7caa.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kenya Banks Suffer Low Loan Uptake as CBK Retains Interest Rate at 13 Percent</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Additionally, he said that prudent management from the CBK has been central to the recovery of the Kenya shilling.</p>"Prudent fiscal management witnessed in the recent past, which have bolstered investor confidence and attracted inflows of foreign capital. Positive economic indicators, stable inflation, and a narrowing current account deficit, are good indicators to investors that Kenya’s economy is resilient and capable of weathering external in shocks, leading to increased demand for the Kenyan shilling both in the external and internal market.Looking at the CBR the CBK has intentionally raised the rates to ensure their are more returns to investment made in Kenya shillings. This increases inflow of foreign direct investments which may explain why the shilling is holding on to gains against the US dollar," said Kathali.<h2>What are Kenya's Forex reserves?</h2><p class=align-left>The CBK also reported that the usable foreign exchange reserves remained adequate at USD 7,148 million (3.8 months of import cover) as of April 4, almost equal to the amount reported in the last week ending March 28.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9500c0aef3bab0f7.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kenyan Newspapers Review: List of Luxurious Items Bought by William Ruto, Other Gov't Officials</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Kathali explained to TUKO.co.ke that the CBK is dealing with the laws of supply and demand, and if they take a huge amount of dollars from circulation into reserves, this could create a slight shortage in the market.</p>"The exchange rate has been stable for almost three weeks now with minimal changes. This means there is a balance between the demand and supply of the shilling and the dollar. If CBK takes dollars from the market and stores them in the reserve they may upset this balance and create a shortage of dollars which may lead to higher demand. If there is a higher demand for dollars then the dollars will start gaining against the shilling. This maybe the rationale behind the slow approach taken by CBK to shore up national reserves," explained Kathali.<h2>NCBA boss projects Kenya shilling will return to its actual value</h2><p class=align-left>In other related news, NCBA managing director and CEO John Gachora argued that the <a href=#>shilling would record a fresh fall</a>, but not to the previous low of KSh 160 per US dollar.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/39475e0f52588dbd.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Videos of Ruto Promising Cheap Gas Surfaces as Cooking Gas Prices Soar: "Nangoja ya KSh 300"</span></p></a><p class=align-left>According to Gachora, the true value of the Kenya shilling lies between the current exchange rate and the historic low of KSh 160.</p><p class=align-left>The Kenya shilling emerged as a <a href=#>top-performing currency globally,</a> surpassing many counterparts, including the British Pound, according to a recent Bloomberg report.</p><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnCu1Kygp52jqHqmr86npqaxX5qwsLrOprBobWRog3mBjKyrq6eenHqssc2ymGarmJ65rbXNoGSsqKWnwG6xwqilqKWZmHqwvNOipKKrnWKwprvSZqCnrpWowbC%2B0mg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
