He and his childhood friend Andrew Ridgeley formed the 80s group Wham! in 1981, and the rest was history. They performed together for five years and had massive chart accomplishments with songs like Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go and, of course, the festive hit Last Christmas. The duo disbanded in 1986 and George continued to find fame solo. He had number one in the US with 1987’s Faith and later Don’t Let the Sun Go Down on Me. But his long career unfortunately came to an end when he passed away at the age of 53, seven years ago today.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-113246503-870x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-george-michael-s-death-on-christmas-day>George Michael’s death on Christmas Day</h2><p>On Christmas Day, 2016, the <a href=#>celebrity</a> tragically died at his home in Oxfordshire. An autopsy came back “inconclusive,” but police stated they didn’t believe there was any foul play in George’s death. Results later suggested the Careless Whisper singer had died of natural causes. Athough, doctors also found he had been suffering from dilated cardiomyopathy with myocarditis and fatty liver.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dilated cardiomyopathy</a> sees the left ventricle in the heart swell, stretch, and become weaker, meaning that blood isn’t pumped as effectively around the body. A <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">fatty liver</a> is often caused by excessive drinking, though it can also occur in those who do not drink any or little alcohol.</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Busy Philipps lived every parent’s worst nightmare when daughter had seizure on FaceTime</a></p><p>George was found dead in his bed by his boyfriend, Fadi Fawaz, who told a 999 operator: “I’ve been waiting for him to wake him up for like, you know, for hours and he wouldn’t wake up, I went to wake him up and he was gone, you know, he’s not there.”</p><p>He later took to X (formerly <a href=#>Twitter</a>) and wrote of his sorrow: “It’s Xmas I will never forget finding your partner dead peacefully in bed first thing in the morning. I will never stop missing you xx.”</p><p>A corner’s statement read: “Enquiries into the death of George Michael have been concluded and the final post mortem report received. As there is a confirmed natural cause of death, being Dilated Cardiomyopathy with Myocarditis and Fatty Liver, the investigation is being discontinued and there is no need for an inquest or any further inquiries.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-george-was-incredibly-generous-and-nobody-knew-it>George was incredibly generous – and nobody knew it</h2><p>After his death on Christmas Day, George Michael was praised by many for the amount of money he donated to charity. Although, he never publicized his help and always donated anonymously.</p><p>From IVF treatment to covering a stranger’s debts, George had a huge heart.</p><p>During an episode of Deal or No Deal, a woman said she was on the game show to win money to be able to pay for IVF. George had been watching the show and called the series’ broadcaster, Channel 4, the next day and gave up the cash without a second thought for her.</p><p>Producer and <a href=#>TV</a> host Richard Osman confirmed the story on X later. He wrote: “A woman on ‘Deal Or No Deal’ told us she needed £15k for IVF treatment. George Michael secretly phoned the next day and gave her the £15k.”</p><p>Amazingly, the woman, whose name is Lynette Gillard, saw the tweet and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">penned</a> a gratitude thank you. She said: “For many years I wondered who had donated this money, and now I know. Thank you. RIP George what an amazing person.”</p><p>Another <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">story</a> saw him give money to a distressed woman in a restaurant who was worried about her debts. He gave the check he’d written to the waitress and was under strict instruction to only give the money once he had left.</p><p>However, sometimes the singer would be open with his generosity, such as when he performed for free to a crowd of NHS nurses. He told the audience in 2006: “Almost 10 years ago, during the last week of my mother’s life, I told my friends and family that if I ever played my own concerts again, I would make sure to do a free one for NHS nurses.</p><p>“The nurses that helped my family at that time were incredible people, and I realized just how undervalued these amazing people are. So I want to thank them with a Christmas concert.”</p><p>A nurse who attended <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>: “A nervous George Michael took to the stage with a bad cold and told us he’d played in front of crowds all over the world but was anxious because he’d never performed in front of so many heroes before. [George] will always be a hero to all of the nurses at the Roundhouse that night.”</p><p>George told the Big Issue in 1995: “I can give away large amounts of money without it having any effect on my life. So you can do a lot of good at arm’s length… which I’m sure people will criticize me for.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-andrew-ridgeley-on-george-s-death>Andrew Ridgeley on George’s death</h2><p>In a statement soon after George passed away, Andrew, 60, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted</a> on X.</p><p>He referred to his band member with his nickname, Yog: “Heartbroken at the loss of my beloved friend Yog. Me, his loved ones, his friends, the world of music, the world at large. 4ever loved. A xx.”</p><p>More recently, the remaining half of Wham! opened up about the impact George Michael’s death had on him. He wrote in his memoir&nbsp;Wham! George Michael & Me: “I honestly thought she was calling to wish me a happy Christmas, or maybe she was with George and the family, and they were ringing to arrange a get-together. There was certainly nothing to hint at the awful news that followed — that George had passed away.</p><p>“The news hit me like a punch to the gut. It was as if my world had been pulled out from underneath me. I put down the phone and, doubled over in grief, began to sob. … I felt crushed by sadness.”</p><p>He continued: “Despite the pain of his death, George is still very much alive in my memory today. A few years on from that tragic Christmas, I’ll sometimes catch myself thinking of our friendship and those years together as young kids in Wham! …</p><p>“And more often than not I’ll remember the laughs we enjoyed together when we were on our own in a bar, or backstage, or traveling, chatting over a beer, or messing around just in each other’s company. When it was just the two of us.”</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Matt Damon’s co-star was ‘devastated’ when he got an Oscar and we all saw it</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpqX2eCcLPEqKmgnV2itqS0wJ6jrGWjqrGlsc1mm56ZpJ16sLqMnJ%2BroaOpuqK%2FjJ2YsmWZqHq0wMilo2aglZa%2Fta7RnpikoZ6cfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
