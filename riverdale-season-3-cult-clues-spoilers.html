That brings this season’s death toll to two—both Ben and Dilton (Major Curda) were found unconscious by Jughead in the final moments of last week’s episode, in what appeared to be the aftermath of a violent satanic ritual. Dilton was DOA, and although Ben recovered, he was driven to kill himself a day later.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Both Ben and Dilton’s deaths are clearly connected to the mysterious cult that’s menacing the town of Riverdale on multiple fronts this season. At this point, we can probably go ahead and assume that the mysterious group Ben and Dilton were involved with is connected to “the Farm” led by Edgar Evernever—even though the crack investigative team that is Bughead don’t seem to have put that together yet.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Here’s everything we know so far about the cult.</p><h2 data-node-id=5 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>1) It seems to be modeled on the real-life Jonestown cult</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Betty and Jughead discover from the coroner that Dilton died by drinking cyanide—specifically cyanide that was mixed into a blueberry drink called "Fresh-Aid." "There’s something dimly familiar about this…" the coroner notes, and he’s not wrong! This is a pretty overt reference to "drinking the Kool-Aid," a phrase coined after the Jonestown Massacre took place in 1978. Under the direction of their "leader" Jim Jones, more than 900 people committed mass suicide by drinking a grape-flavored drink that contained cyanide.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Dilton and Ben’s lips were blue when Jughead found them, and there were chalices nearby, suggesting that both had drunk the Fresh-Aid. In Dilton’s underground forest bunker, Betty and Jughead later find a sign that reads “DRINK THE CORRECT CUP” along with a coin, and Betty interprets this as a challenge to the group: if you drink from the correct chalice, you win. If you drink from the wrong one, you die. In other words, this is a suicide cult, although its followers believe that they will “ascend” rather than die.</p><img alt="Blue, Light, Darkness, Photography, Fun, Performance, Lens flare, " title="Blue, Light, Darkness, Photography, Fun, Performance, Lens flare, " width=1200 height=801 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/rvd302a-0047b-1539892226.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">The CW / DEAN BUSCHER</span></p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>2) They worship The Gargoyle King.</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">All the creepy Satanic talismans Jughead found at the scene—branches, animal bones, a skull—seem to be part of a ritual worship to "The Gargoyle King." Jughead encountered Ben and Dilton playing a role-playing game at Pop’s last week, and the Gargoyle King was mentioned, but he turns out to be an extremely real and extremely scary monster who ambushed Betty and Jughead in the forest. Betty speculated over whether the Gargoyle King was just a person in disguise—say, Ethel Muggs on stilts—but it seems like there may be something genuinely supernatural happening here.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>3) Edgar and Evelyn Evernever are the ringleaders.</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If the Gargoyle King actually is a person in disguise, it has to be Edgar, right? While we’re yet to actually meet Edgar, the revered cult leader who Alice and Polly keep bringing up, his daughter Evelyn (Zoe De Grand Maison) introduces herself to Betty this week. She seems extremely suspect, and apparently paid a visit to Ben in his hospital room while he was in the ICU.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It’s possible that Evelyn compelled Ben to commit suicide by some kind of brainwashing, or maybe he was already brainwashed. Both Ben and Dilton had cyanide in their systems, suggesting that both were supposed to die—but Ben didn’t ingest enough of it to kill him, so his "ascension" was incomplete. “We both flipped the coin. He was scared to ascend, but I’m not,” Ben told Betty and Jughead right before he jumped. His chilling final line: “You’ll see. You’ll fly too.”</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>4) They may have the power to cause seizures.</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Specifically in people they perceive to be a threat. When Betty stumbled on the creepy fire ritual <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a23710407/riverdale-season-3-episode-1-premiere-review/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="in the final moments of last week’s episode" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">in the final moments of last week’s episode</a>, she starts to have a seizure right after she sees the twins levitating. Alice insists she was just hallucinating, and the fire was just a fun cookout with a few Farm pals, while Betty’s doctor that her seizure was just caused by stress. Just in case it's unclear, none of this seems legit!</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In tonight’s episode, Ethel also has a seizure at a critical moment. She tells Betty and Jughead that she and Dilton were dating (she insists it was real, although a different source says they were only together within the role-playing game). They would spend a lot of time together LARPing (Live Action Role Playing, per Google) in Dilton’s underground forest bunker, as you do. When Betty and Jughead press her for more information and threaten to involve the sheriff, Ethel tells them “If any of us talk to any grown-ups, he’s going to get very, very angry,” before she starts to seize.</p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>5) The cult is “the true face of evil."</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">At least according to the new coroner. This younger Dr. Curdle claims to be the son of the Dr. Curdle we’ve seen before, and has taken over running the morgue after his father’s death. (Betty seems to accept this at face value, but we should not! Trust no one!) In any case, Dr. Curdle Jr. takes a look at the symbols on Dilton’s back and concludes that this cult is very, very, very bad news. Way worse than Clifford Blossom or the Black Hood. “We’re looking at the true face of evil,” he tells Betty and Jughead, and seems… kind of excited about it? Hmmmm.</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Camila Mendes Impersonates the Internet" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/2018-camilla-mendes-internet-impressions-thumbnail-clean-1516236292.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 data-node-id=28 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>6) The cult’s existence is all the parents’ fault.</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Maybe. Probably. Newly-anointed mayor, Hermione Lodge calls a meeting of the parents towards the end of the episode to talk about “a vow” they all made in high school decades ago. Eek. She’s worried that "the secret we buried all those years ago" will be revealed. Nobody seems to know what this has to do with them—unless Hermione brings up Ben and Dilton’s blue lips, and the poisoned Fresh-Aid they drank. Tom Keller reminds her they all made a promise never to revisit "that night" or ever speak of it again, but Hermione tells him they can't just stay silent—"not if it's happening again. All of our children are in danger." All the parents look very worried. Pretty sure we’ll hear more about all this in <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a23879943/riverdale-season-3-flashback-episode-kids-as-parents-pictures/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="the October 31 flashback episode" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">the October 31 flashback episode</a>, "The Midnight Club"!</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 e1jtuqk11"></span><h5 class="css-13733z5 e1jtuqk13">See the 'Riverdale' Cast Playing Their Parents</h5><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 e1jtuqk10"></span><img alt='Riverdale -- "Chapter Thirty-Nine: The Midnight Club" Pictured (L-R): Madelaine Petsch as Teen Penelope Blossom, Lili Reinhart as Teen Alice Smith, Ashleigh Murray as Teen Sierra Samuels and Camila Mendes as Teen Hermione Gomez ' src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/rvd304a-0190b-1539826140.jpg title='Riverdale -- "Chapter Thirty-Nine: The Midnight Club" Pictured (L-R): Madelaine Petsch as Teen Penelope Blossom, Lili Reinhart as Teen Alice Smith, Ashleigh Murray as Teen Sierra Samuels and Camila Mendes as Teen Hermione Gomez ' width=1200 height=800 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Open Gallery<span class="css-1w4f7je es31yw60"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt title="Black right arrow" width=100% height=auto decoding=async role=img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/8672d2dc-5b2b-4ad4-bbfb-fd434da819c6.jpg alt="Headshot of Emma Dibdin" title="Headshot of Emma Dibdin" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Emma Dibdin is a freelance writer based in Los Angeles who writes about culture, mental health, and true crime.
