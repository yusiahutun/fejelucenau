"I just wanted to be there for her. I just really wanted her to, like, see me."</p><p>Chyna also admitted that she hasn't watched the documentary in full.</p><p>"I've seen certain clips and things like that," she explained. "I'm the type of person if I see more than what I need to see, I'm gonna have to dig and get to the bottom of certain things and I'm just like, 'Whatever for me is supposed to be for me,' you know what I mean? And I was there for Wendy and I didn't even know that they were, like, filming a documentary."</p><p>Where Is Wendy Williams? was supposed to chronicle Williams' big comeback with a new podcast, but instead offered intimate insight as the beleaguered former talk show host's health declined, leaving her angry, erratic, and struggling again with alcoholism. Shortly before the two-part docuseries was released in February, her team revealed Williams had been diagnosed with primary progressive aphasia and frontotemporal dementia in 2023, receiving the same diagnosis as Bruce Willis.</p><p>And while Chyna said she did not watch all of Where Is Wendy Williams?, she told ET that she thinks it was important that it be made.</p><p>"I definitely think that for me, to be honest, I think it was definitely necessary to be made," she said.</p><p>Chyna continued, "I feel like things these, people actually do need to see it 'cause it is happening and it can really, honestly happen to anybody, you just never know, and hopefully, maybe this is gonna help other people to see 'cause I'm gonna tell you this, I did start it, it did make me upset 'cause the struggling with the alcohol like that was one of my things struggling with the alcohol."</p><p>"So to see Wendy, you know, struggling obviously with the alcohol and her substances over the years, you know, it hurts and it's like the alcohol part with me, so it's like I can relate to that," she concluded. "The part about the dementia, and that the alcohol is what induced it, that triggered me ... 'cause that could have been me."</p><a id=gallery-link-d5911cf4-ce7d-4a86-86f1-f8c89420e5f9 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:d5911cf4-ce7d-4a86-86f1-f8c89420e5f9 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:0132a98d-1357-4c6f-9a62-ca3c296acaae data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/fd/4by3/2024/04/09/fd542330b5584a0db9e724f04f1054a3_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j21mampfl7mir4ycn7KmkWKxpsDAoqOsZZGlvaat0ZqlnJ1drLKvsNhmrqKknJ6urr%2BMnaacraOav6qx0mauobFdo7KksdKsmKuxXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
