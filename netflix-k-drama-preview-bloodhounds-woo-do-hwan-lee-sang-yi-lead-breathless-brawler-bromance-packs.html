Netflix delivers a knockout punch with its barnstorming early summer K-drama series Bloodhounds, the tale of two fresh-faced pugilists who go up against the vilest loan shark that Korean screen entertainment has offered us in years.
The show has a serious case of the wobbles thanks to some off-screen drama in its last few episodes – more on that later – but this is a series filled with the kind of white-knuckle tension that will have you standing up in front of your TV, as though you were ringside at a prize fight."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Characters wear masks in most locales, and check in to buildings with QR codes; sporting events take place before empty stadiums.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One such event is an amateur boxing tournament, where young fighters Kim Gun-woo (Woo Do-hwan) and Hong Woo-jin (Lee Sang-yi) meet for the first time in the final. It’s an evenly matched contest of contrasting styles – Gun-woo is calm and patient, Woo-jin is brash and wild – and the latter’s bravado eventually gets the better of him.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">8 of the best new Korean drama series to look out for in June 2023</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Following a thunderous blow to a kidney, Gun-woo wins the tourney’s 10 million won prize money, almost all of which he plans to give to his mother, whose debts are piling up while her cafe struggles during the pandemic.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He uses the remaining 50,000 won to treat himself and his beaten opponent to a meal.

Gun-woo comes to the rescue and knocks them all down, until Myeong-gil’s wild-eyed top dog arrives and sends him to hospital.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Woo-jin tries to help Gun-woo get his mother out of debt, and an opportunity presents itself when the altruistic former loan shark Choi (Heo Joon-ho) puts a call out for some bodyguards to look after his hot-tempered adoptive granddaughter Kim Hyun-joo (Kim Sae-ron).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hyun-joo has been tracking some small-time operators connected to Myeong-gil’s Smile Capital.

But in truth, that show was influenced by the police academy action-thriller <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Midnight Runners</span></a>, written and directed by Jason Kim (aka Kim Joo-hwan), who makes his drama debut here.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Bloodhounds’ story is a very simple one in which the forces of good and evil stand toe to toe – there’s no murky river of grey separating them.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Though it starts out well, the show really hits its stride around episode three. By then the protagonists have thoroughly won us over, which is tantamount to torture for us viewing at home since this is clearly the kind of story where very bad things are going to happen to them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/06/08/1439b072-46ca-4e38-8c7b-2b5b64116210_ea94c24a.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Woo Do-hwan, of The King: Eternal Monarch, adds a bright-eyed touch to Gun-woo. His character is tough as nails, but he’s the politest pugilist you’re ever likely to meet. Early on he repeatedly bows and apologises to the belligerent drunk he’s ejecting from a bus, to applause from its other passengers.</p>Lee Sang-yi (<a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha</span></a>) adds a dose of humour, and his chemistry with Woo produces a terrific screen bromance.Kim, who wrote the screenplay adapted from the web comic of the same name, demonstrates an impressive command of pacing. This may be a simple story, but he draws us expertly through its beats, maintaining suspense between the spectacular set-piece brawls that give Ma Dong-seok and his hit <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">The Roundup</span></a> franchise a run for their money.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/06/08/4adb4f32-620b-4147-9e8e-cf161af0ce63_ea94c24a.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Setting the show in a world where Covid happened is a clever touch, as it adds relatable weight to the story. Though it reaches a little, Bloodhounds draws compelling parallels between the pandemic and the financial crisis in the late 1990s that forced South Korea to turn to the International Monetary Fund for bailout funds.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It all works beautifully … until a major character suddenly disappears from the story. Kim Sae-ron was caught driving under the influence of alcohol during production of the series in 2022, a case serious enough to put her career on hold. As one of the highlights of a very engaging cast, the loss of Kim is felt acutely.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Recasting her wasn’t an option, so instead the production team appear to have rewritten the last few episodes in a rush, adding an unconvincing replacement female action lead in the form of Jung Da-eun.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There are still some terrific moments in the show’s home stretch, but one can’t help but wonder if this very good show might have been a great one.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Bloodhounds will start streaming on Netflix on June 9.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLhuvM6pZqRllKeurq2OmqmtoZOhsnB%2FkWtqbWllZLumwMWloLFlm2Kxs63MmmSpqpWrtqbDjJujqKeUnby2usOsZLCnn2KxsHnHsJinZZyasm6%2FwKeeZrGZYrmmrcNmmaudkam1rbHSrGSbqpGsuaa%2BjJupqKWRo7Cmec%2BamqSr</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
