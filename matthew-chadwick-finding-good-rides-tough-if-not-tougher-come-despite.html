We went to a couple of theme parks, an aquarium, the food was nice and the club was very helpful. All bar the results it was a very good experience,” he said.</p><p>Chadwick managed two placings aboard gallopers at double-figure odds from his four rides at Happy Valley on Wednesday and knows he’ll have to extract the absolute best out of his mounts at Sha Tin on Sunday if he is to head home a winner.</p><h3><a title href=# data-entity-uuid=dd43ec51-edba-4e04-ab32-77d2cf255554 data-entity-type=node data-entity-bundle=article>Manfred Man seeks clarity around training future: ‘my owners want to know’</a></h3><p>Among his six rides is the Michael Chang Chun-wai-trained Sea Monarch, who chases a second win from three starts in the Class Five Cheong Wan Handicap (1,400m).</p><p>“He’s one of the horses I’m looking forward to riding – Michael has got him going well,” Chadwick said.</p><p>“Gate nine is a bit of a query, but his form is good and the stable is ticking along nicely. He seems healthy and he tries, which is a good thing in Class Five.”</p><p>Chadwick retains the ride aboard last-start Happy Valley winner Classic Unicorn, who is unlikely to get things all his own way in front this time in the Class Two Fife Handicap (1,000m).</p><p>“He’s coming into it fresh and time will tell how much pressure they give us, so it’s hard to put all the ticks against his name. There’s a bit of a question regarding the other runners as well, so we’ll have to wait and see,” the jockey said.</p><p>Chadwick also climbs aboard Miracles, Lady First, Tailor Made and Forever Glorious.</p><p>Comments</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1mq5mTnruoe8Crq6KbnJp8dH2Ya29ubl%2BirrXAx56uZpuYlrG4tcKkZJ%2Bhnpm2r7OMoKaonF2ntqWx0marqK2XnXqqsoynpq1lpKTCqLTEq2Scp52aeqWx0qmgrZ0%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
