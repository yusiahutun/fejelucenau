If you've ever taken a look at Garth Brooks' social media accounts, odds are that you've noticed a particularly odd constant in his comment section: people asking him where the bodies are. Naturally, most know the country superstar for his hit track &#34;Friends In Low Places,&#34; but if this rumor has any footing, Garth may have some friends in even lower places than we all anticipated for years."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

How did the otherwise beloved musician get caught up in such a wild rumor?

However, the fact that hundreds, if not thousands, of users have echoed the same statement under Garth's posts for years is a bit concerning. Do they know something that we don't? Well, maybe, but it's not what you think.</p><p>The whole situation seems to have began when Garth announced his 2018 stadium tour, which he did through a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> that many mocked at the time.</p><p>Then, YMH Studios, a popular comedy channel hosted by Tom Segura, Christina P, and Fahim Anwar, posted a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> where they implicitly alleged that Garth is a murderer with hundreds of bodies hidden on his property. Although the video was purely comedic, YMH Studios fans ran with the claim and it has only snowballed from then on.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Garth's comment section is always filled with people asking him "where are the bodies?"</h2><p>In the years since, you'd be hard-pressed to find one of Garth's posts that aren't filled with comments of users asking him where he's hiding dead bodies. The funniest part of the whole situation is that it doesn't seem as though Garth nor his team know what's going on yet. None of the comments have ever been deleted or archived over the years and every time he shares something new, YHM Studios fans are quick to go off with the murderer rumors.</p><p>So does that mean that Garth is a murderer? Far from it, but sometimes rumors on the internet become so big that the truth gets hidden behind what was initially intended to be nothing more than a joke.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnK6zwMdmmaunn6DAbrnUq5ueqpWneqS7zaynoqqRmMY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
