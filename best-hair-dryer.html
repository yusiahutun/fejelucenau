Lining the aisles of the local drugstore and the shelves of a high-end beauty counter, the hairdryer options are seemingly endless with features seem more fussy than functional. To suss out the best hot tools from the rest of the pack, we decided to test the most buzzed-about hair dryers on the market today.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">But first, we wanted some professional direction on the nonnegotiable features that every truly excellent hair dryer should have. We went straight to four of the industry's leading pros, including <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Giovanni Vaccaro</a>, celebrity hairstylist and co-founder of the on-demand beauty service GlamSquad, celebrity hairstylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="nofollow nocaes">Kira Stuger</a>, Keiko Uehara, CEO and co-founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="nofollow nocaes">Blow Me Away Organic Salon & Headspa</a>, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel="nofollow nocaes">Nicole Karkalis</a>, co-founder of Chicago's blow dry bar <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=5 rel="nofollow nocaes">Blowout Junkie</a>. Each armed with 10 or more years of experience, they told us exactly how to grade the dryers: The <strong>variety and usefulness of its features</strong>, how easy it was to use, and its <strong>overall drying performance</strong>, as well as how our hairstyle looked after each blowout. We used each hair dryer at least twice a week for four weeks and evaluated them as a professional would in order to separate the winners from the wannabes.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-gama-professional-iq2-perfetto-hair-dryer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>GAMA Professional IQ2 Perfetto Hair Dryer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="GAMA Professional IQ2 Perfetto Hair Dryer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ZHH3TpcnoS6mpTljHS1CEl3X2wQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/iq2-perfetto-hair-dryer-by-gama-professional-5d1188b866fb4059a88c172f0c8edd7c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Gamaiqdryer</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Features</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Drying Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Overall Look</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=5><p>Powered by smart features, like a self-cleaning mechanism, a handy temperature sensor and a star nozzle to protect fine hair and sensitive scalps, the IQ2 Perfetto was designed to benefit all hair types, but anyone who appreciates high design and performance will benefit from it.</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Taking home top honors, the GAMA IQ2 Perfetto hair dryer is just about, well, perfetto. With a promise to dry hair 30 percent faster, the IQ2 is designed intelligently, automatically going on standby when placed on its smart pad, outfitted with a micro-perforated filter and temperature sensor, and accompanied by magnetic nozzles. Did we mention it weighs about the same as your smartphone? Our InStyle editor who tested this model has type 3B/3C coarse hair, with a mix of curls and coils that have only been relaxed once years ago, and found that the dryer took just under 15 minutes to diffuse and set her curls. To put it in perspective, our stylist estimated that a full blowout ordinarily would have taken about 25 minutes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The result? Immaculately well-defined curls with an abundance of volume. We loved the way our hair felt after each blowout; it was soft to the touch versus the "crunch" that sometimes happens to curly hair after a blowout.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As soon as we picked it up, we were surprised at how light it was and it never felt heavy or made our arms ache as we dried our hair. It was so easy to use, we’d even call it foolproof, and loved being able to toggle with the heat and airflow options. Despite its time-efficiency, the airflow felt gentle and never too hot on our head and scalp— be sure to still use <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>heat protectant spray</a>. We also appreciated the four attachments that came along with the dryer — a diffuser, two concentrator nozzles, and a star-shaped nozzle specifically for those with fine hair and sensitive scalps.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We noted that despite its compact size, the IQ2 produced a surprisingly loud noise, making it difficult to hear others while the product was in use. For a truly professional-quality tool, though, the cost and the volume are no doubt justifiable.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Heat Settings: </strong>3 <strong>| Wattage</strong>: 2000 W <strong>| Attachments: </strong>Diffuser, two concentrator nozzles, one Venturi nozzle</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-conair-infinitipro-smoothwrap-hair-dryer-with-dual-ion-therapy></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Conair Hair Dryer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Conair InfinitiPRO SmoothWrap Hair Dryer with Dual Ion Therapy" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/I0A4TSn4O88MH6EX6thugWPyV0M=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/conair-infinitipro-smoothwrap-hair-dryer-5e81c55faee543569102d981b29eeb4d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Features</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Drying Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.9</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Overall Look</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We were thoroughly impressed by the blowout produced by the INFINITIPRO SmoothWrap Hair Dryer, transforming our fine, wavy hair into a dreamy blowout in a matter of just 18 minutes flat. Even better, it wasn’t heavy or bulky, and didn’t aggravate our editor’s carpal tunnel.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our fine hair tends to get frizzy, but this hair dryer tamped down on our flyaways while amping up our much-needed volume. After every blowout, our hair looked smooth, straight and healthy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This inexpensive choice does not skimp on value either with a removable filter that will keep the performance high despite how frequently we use it. The attachments it came with — a diffuser and concentrator — were easy to snap on and off, and they remained firmly in place from start to finish.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We thought the design of the handle was great and it fit nicely in our hand during the whole process. While the buttons are located on the handle's right side, making it easy for right-handed people, it can be more difficult for lefties to navigate. All in all, though, the dryer’s power and price point pack a can’t-be-beat punch.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Heat Settings: </strong>3 | <strong>Speed Settings: </strong>2 <strong>|&nbsp;Wattage: </strong>1875 W <strong>| Attachments: </strong>Concentrator nozzle</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-dyson-supersonic-hair-dryer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Dyson Supersonic Hair Dryer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Dyson Supersonic Hair Dryer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/GDUHrXPSvH1hIWhoUlyPGJPeOg8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/dyson-supersonic-hair-dryer-813674451dc34a6f9bc9d06f941b4787.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Features</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.7</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Drying Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.9</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Overall Look</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.9</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.9</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A true investment piece, the Dyson SuperSonic Hair Dryer arrived at our doorstep loaded with five different attachments and a high-powered, three-heat setting panel.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With a strong, even airflow, it took about 20 minutes to thoroughly dry our hair, resulting in a flippy, bouncy look. As for the feel, the architecture of the blow dryer features a long, narrow handle, allowing us to grip comfortably, with a cool shot button as well as a power toggle located directly on the stem, making it shockingly simple for us to go between settings. The heat and high/low buttons are located on the back of the dryer's head, and to change the heat setting, all we had to do was click a button. While there were only three airflow speed settings, we found these were all we needed to attain soft, sleek healthy-looking hair. Plus, it was lightweight enough that our arms didn’t get too tired while blowing out our hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The only thing we didn’t like was the dryer’s cord, which was surprisingly thick, with a large, rectangular power strip right in the middle. It also felt trickier to pull around our sink corners than others we’ve tested.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Heat Settings: </strong>4 <strong>| Speed Settings: </strong>3 | <strong>Wattage: </strong>1600 W <strong>| Attachments: </strong>Flyaway attachment, styling concentrator, diffuser, gentle air attachment, and wide tooth comb</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-fine-hair-t3-aireluxe-professional-hair-dryer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Fine Hair</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>T3 AireLuxe Hair Dryer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="T3 AireLuxe Professional Hair Dryer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/2_Lf-b4VT56Ex2rPgVmejicDcYY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/t3-aireluxe-digital-ionic-professional-blow-hair-dryer-fast-drying-lightweight-and-ergonomic-volume-boosting-frizz-smoothing-multiple-heat-and-speed--a17df8f11ace409c834c159d2206f403.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>T3&nbsp;Micro</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Features</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Drying Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.9</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Overall Look</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Although first impressions aren’t everything, the sleek design of this T3 hair dryer nearly won us over, although we were curious whether such a small hair dryer would be powerful enough for a proper blowout. We have thin hair, and not a lot of it, so we need our hair dryer to be strong enough to whip up a serious amount of volume, and this little guy did just that.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It didn’t take much effort to get the hair dryer up and running — it’s designed in the traditional way in terms of the shape, button placement, and cord length. We used the highest airflow setting to get the power we needed to zhuzh our fine hair, but kept the heat setting between two and three (although we did try out the hottest setting and it was, indeed, quite hot). Within 10 minutes — even on a low heat setting — our hair was totally dry, smooth, and fluffy in the best way possible.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our only gripe is that the cord was thick and got tangled easily. If the cord was retractable, we’d say this option is pretty much perfect, especially for someone looking to really increase volume in fine hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Heat Settings: </strong>5 <strong>| Speed Settings:</strong> 3 <strong>| Wattage:</strong> 1875 W <strong>| Attachments: </strong>Diffuser and comb attachment sold separately</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-thick-hair-babylisspro-porcelain-ceramic-carrera2-dryer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Thick Hair</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>BaBylissPRO Porcelain Ceramic Carrera2 Dryer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="BaBylissPRO Porcelain Ceramic Carrera2 Dryer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/dKpka4L9f6AgCz1fB0RSBb6TAXY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/BaBylissPRO-Porcelain-Ceramic-Carrera2-Dryer-7fb754be54a64503aceefb0c7273b24b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Features</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.6</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Drying Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.2</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Overall Look</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This hair dryer may not have all the bells and whistles of the fancier (and pricier) options on this list, but it gets the job done beautifully. We found this dryer to be one of the most powerful we’ve ever tested and were shocked that it dried our thick, wavy hair in less than 10 minutes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Although there are only three heat settings — low, medium, and high — it really felt like there was a difference between each level, while still putting out a consistent stream of air. We mostly stayed with the medium setting because the highest option was so hot that it was uncomfortable at times. We dry our hair once or twice a week, and our favorite style to create is a traditional full-bodied, bouncy blowout, which was easy to accomplish with this dryer — and fast.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our one caveat is that the blow dryer wasn’t exactly easy on our arms.

While the airstream wasn't as concentrated as we might have liked, it nonetheless earns top marks as an option for those struggling with damaged hair, with its intentionally quieter airflow. When tested on long, thick and curly hair, we found the Halo offered a 54-minute blowout that left it looking smooth, straight and less frizzy when compared to our blowout pre-Halo.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Instead of separate heat and speed settings, the Zuvi is outfitted with four modes that combine the two, termed “care, fast, soft, and style.” We particularly loved that it allowed us to easily toggle with heat and airflow settings, for a feeling of control over the tool. In fact, once we tried different settings, we found that the "Care" option was ideal for drying our hair daily without inflicting long-term damage.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Sleekly designed with just two easy-to-use buttons, including an on/off button that slides up and down, and a second button for toggling between settings, the Instagrammably pretty tool has enough grip to hold it comfortably. Plus, it’s compact enough to store or travel without added hassle, and the accompanying storage bag and stand prove useful both at home and on the road.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Halo uses infrared light to dry water on the hair’s surface, leading to less damage to the hair itself, and the only real downside in sight is perhaps an upside for those looking for a calmer way to dry: Its muted flow is not as powerful as other brands’.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Heat and speed settings: </strong>4 <strong>|&nbsp;Wattage: </strong>680 W <strong>| Attachments: </strong>Diffuser, concentrator, gentle air attachment</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-travel-sri-dryq-hair-dryer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Travel</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>SRI DryQ Hair Dryer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="SRI DryQ Hair Dryer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/kAZ_d8JU_giNUkTdo-VG8uiya7A=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/SRI-DryQ-Hair-Dryer-5237d20a416a4ae694add5bc4a77692d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>SRI DryQ</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Features</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.7</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Drying Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.6</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Overall Look</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.2</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.2</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=3><p>Foldable and lightweight, this ionic dryer is easy enough to take on the go, but so smartly designed that it serves well as a daily hair dryer, too.</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Adorned with rose gold accents and arriving in a hyper compact size, the SRI DryQ Hair Dryer is small enough to store yet pretty enough to leave out on the hotel bathroom’s counter. We were thoroughly impressed with how fast the SRI DryQ acted, cutting down the dry time on our thick, curly hair post-shower markedly, thanks to its settings and strong airflow. We were also surprised by how powerful the motor was, despite its small size. Under 12 ounces and with a decibel level of just 79 (compared to traditional dryers that clock in around 90 or higher), our favorite travel pick is one of the quietest dryers we've encountered.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The 8-foot-plus cord makes it usable enough for using while on the go, where outlets are placed in often-inconvenient locations. While the heat doesn't feel as powerful as other models', it’s deceiving, as the dryer was fierce enough to also get a smooth blow dry done on our limp, fine hair without creating the dreaded “crispy” feel. Another plus: the magnetic attachments proved seamless to attach and detach, and the slimmer nozzle in particular offered a concentrated airflow that made blow drying hair straight a breeze.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We didn't love the design of the buttons; the temperature settings, for example, required two hands to adjust, and the lock button on the handle was located too close to the on switch. (During our testing, we accidentally locked the settings on medium and weren’t able to undo the setting easily.) But if you’re in the market for a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>travel dryer</a> that’s chic and powerful enough to dry your tresses super quickly without frying them, this is a dryer to strongly consider.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Heat Settings: </strong>4 | <strong>Speed Settings: </strong>3 <strong>|&nbsp;Wattage: </strong>1300 W <strong>| Attachments: </strong>One diffuser, two nozzles</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-frizzy-hair-conair-infinitipro-digitalaire-hair-dryer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Frizzy Hair</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Conair InfinitiPRO DigitalAIRE Hair Dryer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Conair InfinitiPRO DigitalAIRE Hair Dryer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/TamuBmHzLx8NmhHTFvmas5Iuv9Q=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/CONAIR-INFINITIPRO-DigitalAIRE-Hair-Dryer-8f8d0632a013446aafed9f2effaaeed8.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Features</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.7</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Drying Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Overall Look</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Just about on par with models that are double its price, the InfinitiPRO by Conair DigitalAire Dryer gets the frizz out, taming tortured hair smooth with ease. In fact, it blew out our fine, wavy hair within 30 minutes, commanding an airflow so strong that it sent the curtains swaying in our room. (That force is likely due to the fast-moving digital motor, which revs at 90,000 times per minute!). The high level of heat is also conducive to wrangling frizz.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It works on different hair textures, too; we found that when tested on our thick, straight hair, it was whipped into frizz-free shape in under 10 minutes, whereas ordinarily it would require a 20-minute session to take our hair from wet to dry. When we used it with the accompanying concentrator on coarse, kinky hair, the dryer cut drying time down to under 20 minutes, which was a pleasant surprise for us, given that our hair would normally require a full 12 hours to air-dry.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Similar to the noted downside of our budget pick, which is also from Conair, the button placement on this higher-end model caused a bit of a pause for us. Located on the side of the device and positioned close together, the buttons are sensitive and we found it became too easy to switch settings accidentally. It’s lightweight and easy enough to grab, but if you happen to handle it the wrong way, you'll likely interfere with any saved settings. Plus, the handle is designed for those who are right-handed, making it more difficult to use for left-handed people.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">All that said, the quality of the blowout rendered by the INFINITIPRO makes it the top choice on our list for those looking to bust frizz, whether in a straight blowout or a curly ‘do. It comes with a concentrator and a diffuser, too, making the process even easier.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Heat Settings: </strong>3 | <strong>Speed Settings: </strong>3 <strong>| Wattage: </strong>1875 W <strong>| Attachments: </strong>Concentrator and diffuser</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-brush-shark-hyperair-hair-dryer-with-iq-2-in-1-concentrator--styling-brush></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Brush</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Shark HyperAir Hair Dryer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Shark HyperAir Hair Dryer with IQ 2-in-1 Concentrator &amp;amp; Styling Brush" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/y9-mn4eMGt_tAXUW7VNzD03pzKA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/shark-hyperair-hair-dryer-2847d88a14bc4ace90c070c738d7104a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Shark</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.9</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Features</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Drying Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Overall Look</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.9</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=4><p>With perfectly placed buttons and an easy-to-use brush design, this dryer is lightweight and, for the most part, easy to maneuver, even for an amateur.</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We love a good multitasking product, and the Shark HyperAir Hair Dryer is certainly no exception to the rule; it’s an ideal choice for those seeking the best dryer-brush combo. Our fine, dense and wavy hair benefited from a 30-minute blowout, which left it smooth, without any noticeable flyaways.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though we used it mainly on the medium setting, as that level of airflow was powerful enough, we liked having the option of additional power. But best of all were the results: Body, bounce, and no need for hairspray, which is typically the case for us. The variety of looks the dryer can create, thanks to the accompanying tools, is also a plus; we also tested on very thick, dense, coarse hair and it was transformed into both straight, and full and curly looks using the thoughtfully designed adjustable attachments.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With evenly-distributed and fast-acting ionic heat, sealed in by a cool-shot button, the device is designed to dry and straighten simultaneously. Emitting a low, high-tech hum versus the typical soundblast associated with most dryers, the Shark tool has three different air speeds, ranked low, medium, and high. Yet we found that “strong, stronger, and very strong” might be more apt descriptions — even on the lowest setting, the air is forceful and consistent.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Hyper Air comes with two attachments, the IQ 2-in-1 Concentrator and the IQ Styling Brush. The concentrator includes a dial to toggle between wide and narrow airflow, and users can rotate the attachment itself to ensure that the airflow is always in line with a brush while blowing out hair. A diffuser is also available, although it's sold separately, which was disappointing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Heat Settings: </strong>3 | <strong>Speed Settings: </strong>3 <strong>|&nbsp;Wattage: </strong>1680 W <strong>| Attachments: </strong>Concentrator and styling brush</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-curly-hair-pattern-blow-dryer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Curly Hair</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Pattern Blow Dryer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Pattern Blow Dryer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Ffwk50fFXhptRRv_E67WJPO3E9k=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/PATTERN-Blow-Dryer-5cca5ee5fe484dbf8c265e30351314de.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Features</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Drying Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Overall Look</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With a super chic vortex design that helps to control airflow and a matte caramel colorway, the Pattern’s good looks are only the beginning of its story as a curl-enhancing hot tool.

But the results are in the blowout itself: Softer, smoother, straighter and more voluminous hair was ours for the taking, post-Pattern blowout. We particularly appreciated the cool shot button, which acted quickly, cutting off all heat, and the tool’s even, powerful airflow.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-73 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our experience varied depending on the type of hair. While our wavy hair did receive the results we set out to achieve (a straight blowout without the need for a follow-up tool), our coily hair still needed a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>second tool to straighten the ends</a>. The wide-tooth comb wasn't particularly useful for drying our kinky hair, not completely drying it and leaving the ends puffy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-74 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The accompanying attachments make it one of the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>best blow dryers for curly hair </a>for creating different looks.

Our slightly wavy hair, prone to breakage and frizz, was a testament to the tool’s impact: Our dried hair looked impossibly smooth, without a single frizzy flyaway in sight. Armed with powerful heat, the dryer also earned our trust for its even distribution, and our hair didn’t start sizzling the way it might with a lesser-quality dryer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-82 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The dryer's small size and its smaller-than-typical nozzle didn't impact its ability to dry our thick and wavy hair, but it did mean that we had to section our hair a bit more than we usually would in order to achieve the right surface area for an even, quality blowout. Even on the lowest setting, the airflow proved powerful; and across each of the settings, it remained consistent and even. It also worked quickly, drying our thick, chest-length hair in a mere 15 minutes post-shower.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-83 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Among the downsides, though, were the slightly confusing buttons, which don't clearly indicate the temperature, and a delay on the cold shot button, as well as the attachments. Though the Bondi Boost Sonic Dryer comes with an air concentrator and a diffuser, both were at first tricky to attach as well as to take off without an extra set of helping hands.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-84 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Heat Settings: </strong>4 | <strong>Speed Settings: </strong>3 <strong>| Wattage: </strong>1875 W <strong>| Attachments: </strong>Concentrator and diffuser</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-with-diffuser-panasonic-nanoe-hair-dryer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best with Diffuser</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Panasonic Nanoe Hair Dryer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Panasonic Nanoe NA67W Hair Dryer with Oscillating Quick-Dry Nozzle" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Nyj7RnqnFT7fovnlQETkHcCj590=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Panasonic-Nanoe-NA67W-Hair-Dryer-with-Oscillating-Quick-Dry-Nozzle-156751f927044d3fbd2d724bcc9a4a08.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Panasonic</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-89 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The right diffuser can make or break your look, and your strands. The Panasonic Nanoe gave us a voluminous and sleek blowout, thanks to its oscillating nozzle, which gently moves back and forth to distribute heat efficiently, dry hair fast, and prevent hot spots along the way. In our test, the oscillating nozzle did exactly what it claimed to do, dispersing heat evenly across our frizzy, wavy hair so that no single section of hair felt burnt no matter how long the heat was directed its way.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-90 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The diffuser seemed to mimic the movement of our hand when blast-drying the hair, which in turn helped to reduce any fatigue from holding the dryer. The ionic tool also boasted another pleasant surprise — we didn't need to use a straightener as usual on our wavy hair to smooth out any remaining baby hairs. With the Nanoe, we were able to create a smooth look with a slight wave at the bottom, without the need for any follow-up tools.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-91 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One editor with wavy, thick and dry hair, who was accustomed to using the highest heat settings, found that this dryer didn’t cut down on her drying time as much as she would have liked. Still, the resulting blowout, which took about 35 minutes, included smooth-to-the-touch tresses and a minimal amount of flyaways.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-92 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Heat Settings: </strong>2 | <strong>Speed Settings: </strong>3 <strong>|&nbsp;Wattage: </strong>1875 W <strong>| Attachments: </strong>Diffuser and concentrator nozzle</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-professional-harry-josh-pro-tools-ultra-light-pro-dryer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Professional</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Harry Josh Pro Tools Ultra Light Pro Dryer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Harry Josh Pro Tools Ultra Light Pro Dryer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/PcHKsnu5dcyit5F_yQ5R9JFsVns=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Harry-Josh-Pro-Tools-Ultra-Light-Pro-Dryer-dc115e72aaee4a2fbc71e5e81a87c6d0.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Harry Josh</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Features</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Drying Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Overall Look</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=4><p>Quiet and lightweight, with an astounding number of settings (12!), this French-born tool is designed for professional use, but beauty buffs of varying skill levels will still appreciate its features.</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-95 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Put to use on our very thick, long, wavy hair (which historically takes forever to dry), the Harry Josh Ultra Light Pro Dryer proved its prowess as the best professional-grade tool in its class. This mint-green, French-made dryer weighs in at under a pound, yet produces a powerful airstream that goes virtually unheard, thanks to its patented silencer that drops the noise volume considerably. With a 22-minute blow dry completed on fine, color-treated hair, the dryer delivered a sleek, salon-quality blowout with no heat damage reported.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-96 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Quiet and controlled, the airflow and temperature were reflective of the dryer’s professional standing, and our hair and scalp didn't feel scorched, or even slightly overheated, at any point during the trial. At the hands of the luxe, lightweight and effective tool, the resulting blowout of our hair felt like a professional one.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-97 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Yet the dryer’s features aren't just for the pros. Anyone who uses a dryer daily will appreciate the tool's longevity (an A/C motor that lasts 2,000 hours), its efficiency (the dual-filtration system drops energy use by 70 percent), and its impressive multitude of settings (12 heat, speed and ion settings). Equipped with one of the longest nozzle attachments we tested meant that we could direct heat in specific sections. We were particularly pleased that using the nozzle in such a targeted way didn’t result in a scorching sensation.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-98 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As the cute green color chipped off when we dropped it, the hair dryer may not be as durable as some of the other options on this list.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-99 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Heat Settings: </strong>3 |<strong> Wattage: </strong>1875 W <strong>| Attachments: </strong>Two nozzles: A traditional nozzle designed for drying small sections, and a long nozzle with a cooler temperature for drying larger areas faster</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-runner-up-best-overall-hot-tools-pro-artist-black-gold-2000-watt-ionic-hair-dryer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Runner Up, Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Hot Tools Pro Artist Black Gold Ionic Hair Dryer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Hot Tools Pro Artist Black Gold 2000 Watt Ionic Hair Dryer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/pZModzWp-j0cI3jIamHjuWGgT80=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/hot-tools-pro-artist-black-gold-2000-watt-ionic-hair-dryer-5c89a3edfca84e9293dbe0f5c9686e7d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Features</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Drying Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Overall Look</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=3><p>With its comfortable grip, user-friendly features, and ability to deliver professional-level results, it's hard to believe this blow dryer is under $150.</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-103 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you're a novice when it comes to blowouts, the Pro Artist Black Gold 2000 Watt Ionic Hair Dryer might sound intimidating, but it's actually as user-friendly as it gets. Balancing a hair dryer in one hand — while using your fingers to maneuver the different modes — and using a styling brush in another is no easy feat, but with this Hot Tools dryer, the whole process is simple. Although the dryer is equipped with three heat settings and two speed settings, toggling back and forth between the different modes is straightforward, thanks to the grooves in the center of each switch. I'd consider myself a blow dryer beginner (I'm partial to blow dry brushes), but I was able to navigate my way between the heat and power settings without having to pause the drying session or accidentally pressing the wrong button.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-104 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The pro-grade dryer comes with an ionizer switch at the top that lets you customize your blowout to your needs. All you have to do is simply press 'volume' or 'smoothing' and let the ionic blow dryer do its thing. I personally went for the smoothing option as my wavy hair was looking particularly unruly on the testing day. I'm happy to report that the smoothing option does exactly what it says it will — I was left with a sleek blowout, even on a humid summer day in New York City.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-105 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One thing to note: If you have a smaller space (like a tiny apartment), the nine foot chord might get in the way while styling or stowing away, but otherwise this dryer has everything you'll need for a salon-quality blowout at home.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-106 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Heat Settings</strong>: 3 | <strong>Speed Settings</strong>: 2 | <strong>Wattage</strong>: 2000 W | <strong>Attachments:</strong> Diffuser</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-value-conair-infinitipro-smoothwrap-hair-dryer-with-dual-ion-therapy></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Value</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Conair Hair Dryer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Conair InfinitiPRO SmoothWrap Hair Dryer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/I0A4TSn4O88MH6EX6thugWPyV0M=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/conair-infinitipro-smoothwrap-hair-dryer-5e81c55faee543569102d981b29eeb4d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Features</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Drying Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.9</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Overall Look</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-110 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The SmoothWrap Hair Dryer with Dual Ion Therapy proves that a good hair dryer doesn't need to break the bank.

It also comes with a diffuser (a round attachment you can slide on the nozzle of your hair dryer to spread the air stream over a wider area to minimize damage) and a concentrator (the wide, flat, duckbill-looking tool that directs airflow into a smaller, concentrated area of your hair to help you style your hair with ease.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-111 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The high speed with low heat dried our hair fast — in four and a half minutes to be exact, without any attachments. After drying, we used the concentrator, which smoothed out our hair nicely and reduced the look of frizz.

We found it intuitive to use and all of the buttons are where they should be, making it easy to push and move between different speeds and heat, even with the smaller design. The price is a little steep, but it works as well as other T3 blow dryers, except that it folds up. The dryer also has auto-dual voltage, meaning it can be used anywhere in the world — so no matter where your travels take you, a sleek blowout will always be available. It's worth noting that the highest heat setting isn't super hot, but it didn't bother us, as it kept us from burning our hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-146 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Heat Settings</strong>: 3 | <strong>Speed Settings</strong>: 2 | <strong>Wattage</strong>: 1500 W | <strong>Attachments:</strong> Concentrator</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-our-testing-process></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Our Testing Process</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There's no better way to learn the ins and outs of a hair styling tool than by asking the very people who use them every day.

Fine or damaged hair may benefit from a lower heat setting, while thicker or curly hair may require a higher heat setting.

If you have textured or long, thick hair, you may want to opt for a hair dryer with a higher wattage, fine, thinning, or short hair can get away with lower. “A higher wattage hair dryer will typically be more powerful and dry your hair faster,” explains Uehara.

If you have thick or curly hair, a higher wattage dryer with a concentrator nozzle may be more effective."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For those who want to “take textured hair straight, you’ll need a concentrator attachment to smooth out strands and create shine,” says Giovanni Vaccaro, hairstylist and co-founder of the on-demand beauty service, GlamSquad. “I prefer a thin attachment that helps concentrate air on a smaller section.” The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Pattern Blow Dryer</a> comes with brush, wide tooth comb, diffuser, and concentrator nozzle and is great for curly hair.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do you use a hair dryer diffuser?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Diffusers are a curly girl's best friend, as long as you know how to use them,” says Vaccaro. So, what’s the best way to use a diffuser?

Two: Place damp or wet hair on the diffuser gently and allow the diffuser to do the work. The less you touch your hair, the better. Three: Flip your hair over and diffuse the underneath sections of your hair. Four: Once hair is 90 percent dry, you can start scrunching and touching it to give yourself the final shape.” How simple is that?</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Can you bring a hair dryer on a plane?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Yes.

You can find a hair dryer for less than $20, but keep in mind that most cheap models deliver a lot of heat without a lot of power, which means it'll take longer to dry your hair, and you'll face the risk of heat damage. If you have specific hair needs, are looking for particular attachments, or have the budget to splurge, invest more to get a dryer with all the bells and whistles.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What does a blow dryer cool shot button do?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">According to celebrity hairstylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Joel James</a>, a cool shot button is a must to prevent burning and to lock your style in place. "The cool shot button feature is what keeps the hair at a good temperature, even when you've been using a hot setting." It's best to use the cool shot button when your hair needs to be cooled down. For example, if you're drying your hair with a heat setting, use the cool shot button as a final step to cool everything down and set it in place.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How can you protect your hair from heat damage when using a hair dryer?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You should always take hair damage into consideration because you don't want to make matters worse by frying your hair. According to Stewart, if you have heat damage, try drying hair on a low setting with warm or cool air instead of with hot air on a high setting. "In addition, you can use a heat protectant or serum prior to blow drying to protect your strands," she says. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="u1=${REQUEST_ID}-${DOC_ID}">Bumble and bumble Hairdresser's Invisible Oil Heat & UV Protective Primer</a> is one of our favorites because it provides heat and UV protection, moisturizes, detangles, and cuts down frizz.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How can you use a blow dryer for a silky blowout?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To get a smooth, sleek blowout, James says to use a concentrator nozzle and a hair brush. Wrap your hair around the brush, then, point the nozzle directly at the brush without touching the bristles. "To prevent heat damage, keep the nozzle at least 1 inch away from the brush and don't stay at one spot for long," he explains. "Blow dry each section in fluid motions until you've finished your whole head of hair."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-instyle-picks></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Is InStyle Picks?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Did you notice the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>InStyle Picks seal of approval</a> at the top of this story?
