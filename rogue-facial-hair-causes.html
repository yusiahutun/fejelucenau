"The reason that many of us do not notice the white hairs before they are long is because [of their light color] and therefore are not noticeable until they become quite long," explains dermatologist S. Manjula Jegasothy, MD, CEO and founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Miami Skin Institute</a>. To find out more about this phenomenon, we tapped Dr. Jegasothy and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Jodi Shays</a>, esthetician and owner of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>Queen Bee Salon & Spa</a>, who let us in on everything there is to know about random long facial hairs.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-causes-long-white-facial-hair></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Causes Long, White Facial Hair?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There's no single medical term for a rogue strand of hair that appears on your face — nor is there one direct cause. "There are different types of white hairs, I find those that come from women suffering from PCOS (hormonal) tend to have more than a handful of thick, beard-like white hairs," says Shays.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Just like long black hair that grows on the face and neck, these white hairs are also random (genetically mutant) hair that grows during times of hormonal fluctuation in specific places, such as the chin, neck, and t-zone," adds Dr. Jegasothy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Also, a single outcropping of white hair can occur in an area that has an overall skin pigmentation issue such as vitiligo, Dr. Jegasothy tells us. "However, vitiligo is rather rare, so most people who experience these hairs may be experiencing them because of temporary pigmentation disruption, such as a superficial skin fungus from going to the beach," she explains.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-should-you-remove-unwanted-facial-hair></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Should You Remove Unwanted Facial Hair?</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Tweeze</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Perhaps the simplest way to remove a single long white facial hair is by tweezing. We recommend <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Queen Bee Tweezers</a> thanks to their solid grip and high-quality design. "Don't worry about plucking the hair out; it won't cause more to grow," Dr. Jegasothy reassures us.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Consider Waxing</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Waxing</a> is a preferred way to remove unwanted facial and neck hairs on clients only if those hairs are few and very fine — but there is a caveat," says Shays. If those hairs come from people suffering from PCOS, waxing is best avoided due to sensitivity. "It can cause irritation such as folliculitis and you have to wait for the hair to grow out to a length long enough to wax," says Shays.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Give Dermaplaning a Go</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Looking for a smooth hairless complexion? Dermaplaning may be the solution. This exfoliation technique involves carefully swiping a sharp blade across the surface of your skin to remove dead skin, sebum, and any unwanted hair.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Turn to Electrolysis</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"FDA-approved electrolysis is the only permanent way to remove unwanted hairs," confirms Shays.&nbsp;"Electric current is passed through the shaft of the hair and basically destroys the whole follicle. It stops producing a hair." However, this treatment may not be for everyone. "I recommend this to my clients who are going through hormonal fluctuations and have more than a handful of hairs on their chins and necks. Most lasers do not work on white hairs so I do not recommend that for these specific types of nuisance hairs," says Shays.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Try Threading</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"At Queen Bee, we prefer to thread thicker white hair on the face," Shays tell us. "This ancient technique glides over the skin and pulls hairs out one by one from the base of the follicle. It is less irritating than waxing, but it can still be a little painful."&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-when-should-you-see-a-dermatologist></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>When Should You See a Dermatologist?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you've been spending excess time in the sun, Dr. Jegasothy recommends treating the area where you're experiencing white facial hair with a prescription antifungal cream for two weeks. And if the hairs cease to regain their color, make another visit to the dermatologist to rule out a larger issue like vitiligo or other pigment-related disorders.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZMCstc1oqaifpZp6p63CopilZZiWtrN5wpqsrJ2j</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
