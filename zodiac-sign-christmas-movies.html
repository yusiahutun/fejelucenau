While one zodiac sign might prefer to watch a movie that reminds them of being a kid and sending letters to the North Pole, another sign might rather see something about adults falling in love under the mistletoe.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/disney-plus-free-trial.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/askawitch_question3.jpg><p>Likewise, one sign might prefer a more sentimental and <a href=#>romantic flick</a>, while another just wants to laugh until eggnog starts spewing out of their nose.

This mischievous zodiac sign can relate to the way Kevin McCallister constantly gets blamed for literally everything. Watching the underestimated eight-year-old prove himself by protecting his family’s house from two conmen will make an Aries feel so seen.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SS.Grinch.jpg><h2>Taurus: How the Grinch Stole <a href=# id=auto-tag_christmas data-tag=christmas>Christmas</a>&nbsp;(2000)</h2><p>A Taurus tends to wear their stubbornness like a badge of pride, which means they not only see where the reclusive Grinch is coming from; they relate to it. This zodiac sign knows how to hold a grudge, which makes the grumpy Grinch a character they can empathize with. Plus, how can a Taurus not appreciate the colorful aesthetics of Whoville?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/7O0lgo2ukEMhMyYw9TFV1t1iftU.0.jpg><h2>Gemini: Love Actually (2003)</h2><p>Geminis are known for their tendency to get bored, but the many intersecting love triangles present in Love Actually are more than enough to keep them paying attention from start to finish. Plus, a Gemini can’t help but appreciate the dry, British wit that will titillate their sense of humor.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Small-Image-Article-Blog-71-1.png><h2>Cancer: The Holiday (2006)</h2><p>For a romantic and sentimental Cancer, The Holiday has got it all. Watching a movie about four people overcoming their internal conflicts and finding true love will make a Cancer feel fully immersed in the spirit of the season. Plus, Cancers are natural homebodies, and the premise of two women switching homes for the holidays is enough to make them press “Play”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/LAH_SAlone_16_9_1920x1080_1309110_1920x1080.jpeg><h2>Leo: Last Holiday (2006)</h2><p>Leos are creative showstoppers who always have lofty plans for themselves. As soon as they find out the overlooked Georgia Byrd only has a few weeks to live, a Leo will be fully on board with her mission to finally make all her dreams happen. Last Holiday&nbsp;reminds a Leo that it’s never too late to do what you want with your life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Polar_Express_WIDE.jpeg><h2>Virgo: The Polar Express (2004)</h2><p>The classic tale of The Polar Express reminds a thoughtful Virgo of simpler times. In fact, they probably read the book growing up; Virgos love a tried and true story that never gets old! Plus, their detail-oriented mindset helps them appreciate the vivid and enchanting animation, which was especially groundbreaking during the early 2000s when it was released.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/happiest-season-featuredimage-e1607984167447-900x593-1.png><h2>Libra: Happiest Season (2020)</h2><p>Clever and flirtatious Libra can’t resist a star-studded dramedy about a relationship finding its footing. A Libra will identify with Happiest Season’s Abby as she tries to navigate the politics of visiting her girlfriend’s uptight family over the holidays. Libras will also love an opportunity to debate whether or not Abby deserves better!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/5f75f31674fe5b0018a8e7a0.webp><h2>Scorpio: The Nightmare Before Christmas&nbsp;(1990)</h2><p>It’s no secret that Scorpios have a penchant for the dark, macabre and taboo. It’s no wonder that <a href=#>The Nightmare Before Christmas</a> is your favorite holiday movie, because it covers all three! While it’s not the most festive holiday film—and it’s certainly not the most traditional—this mischievous flick will make a Scorpio season right at home. Because you know Scorpios are still pining over Halloween, this movie acts as a nice balance between freaky and festive.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-bad-santa-movie-quotes.jpeg><h2>Sagittarius: Bad Santa (2003)</h2><p>Whether it’s the holidays or not, a Sagittarius just wants to see a movie that makes them laugh from beginning to end. That’s why Bad Santa is right up their alley! This film about a misanthropic conman who works as a department store Santa Claus proves that holiday movies can be just as naughty as they are nice.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/a-christmas-story.webp><h2>Capricorn: A Christmas Story (1983)</h2><p>Capricorns can be surprisingly nostalgic, which is they they often opt to put on a classic instead of the latest release. This ambitious and hardworking zodiac sign will relate to Ralphie’s mission to get the gift of his dreams—a Red Ryder air rifle. They’ll also relate to Ralphie’s grumpy dad and his obsession with the table lamp shaped like a woman’s leg that he was awarded in a contest.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-28-at-5.07.02-PM.png><h2>Aquarius: It’s a Wonderful Life (1946)</h2><p>Quirky and eccentric Aquarius is the humanitarian of the zodiac, which means they love movies with artistic merit and a meaningful message. It’s a Wonderful Life has stood the test of time for a reason! An Aquarius will feel so moved by the sacrifices George Bailey has had to make, and they’ll be reaching for a box of tissues by the time George realizes how much those sacrifices meant to his family and friends in Bedford Falls.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/elf-movie-scene-1.png><h2>Pisces: Elf (2003)</h2><p>Pisces are known for their compassion and spirituality, but their vivid imagination is what really sets them apart from others. Elf is a sweet, uplifting comedy that’s all about tapping into the power of your imagination and believing in magic. Buddy may be a fully grown man running around New York City dressed as an elf, but his imagination is what saves the spirit of Christmas.</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/banner-newsletter_july2020.jpg alt="StyleCaster newsletter" width=670 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme9mom6KZk2R%2Bc3%2BWbG5yZ6qksaqtwmaqop%2BeYrCpvsisq6aZo2K6sMLInqpo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
