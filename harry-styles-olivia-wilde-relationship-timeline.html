"Little known fact: most male actors don’t want to play supporting roles in female-led films. The industry has raised them to believe it lessens their power (i.e financial value) to accept these roles, which is one of the reasons it’s so hard to get financing for movies focusing on female stories.

She shared his song "Music for a Sushi Restaurant," using it to soundtrack a black-and-white clip from the 2018 film Cold War, where the female lead dances around a bar while drinking a cocktail. She also captioned the post with the hands raised in worship emoji, per <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://pagesix.com/2022/05/20/olivia-wilde-posts-boyfriend-harry-styles-song-on-instagram/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Page Six" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Page Six</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=86 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The track itself includes a possible nod to Wilde, with lyrics that seem to refer to her green eyes.

Specifically referring to a "dark as hell ... strange scene, full of fascist references, and a disturbing amount of male rage," in which Styles acted alongside costar Chris Pine, Wilde said, "Harry took it to another level. He was so fully in the moment, he began screaming the lines to the crowd, in this primal roar, that was way more intense than anything we expected from the scene."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=92 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">His work "left us all in tears," she said.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=93 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"The camera operator followed [Harry] as he paced around the stage like a kind of wild animal," Wilde continued. "We were all gobsmacked at the monitor. I think even Harry was surprised by it. Those are the best moments for an actor—when you're completely outside your body."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=94 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Also in the interview, Styles spoke candidly about why he has decided to keep romantic relationships and his sexuality to himself.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=95 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I've never talked about my life away from work publicly and found that it's benefited me positively," he told the magazine. "There's always going to be a version of a narrative, and I think I just decided I wasn't going to spend the time trying to correct it or redirect it in some way."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=96 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">He added, "Sometimes people say, 'You've only publicly been with women,' and I don't think I've publicly been with anyone. If someone takes a picture of you with someone, it doesn't mean you're choosing to have a public relationship or something."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=97 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Of his upcoming performance as a closeted gay police officer in My Policeman, Styles said, "I think everyone, including myself, has your own journey with figuring out sexuality and getting more comfortable with it."</p><h2 data-node-id=98 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">August 2022: Olivia gets real about keeping their relationship private.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=99 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Speaking with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://variety.com/2022/film/features/olivia-wilde-harry-styles-sex-scenes-dont-worry-darling-1235347929/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Variety class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Variety</a>, the director opened up about her and Styles's decision to keep matters of the heart out of the public spotlight.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=100 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I'm not going to say anything about it because I've never seen a relationship benefit from being dragged into the public arena," she said. "We both go out of our way to protect our relationship; I think it's out of experience, but also just out of deep love."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=101 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Wilde's split from Jason Sudeikis and the following upending of their family's dynamic shouldn't be deemed a spectacle by the tabloids or public, Wilde continued. "The last two years, my family has gone through this kind of restructuring and a revolution that should be a totally personal experience," she said. "And it's not. The most painful element of it has been women shaming me for making a decision that was for my own health and happiness."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=102 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She added that there are misogynist undertones when people judge her based on paparazzi photos of her and Styles. "When people see me not with my kids, it's always 'How dare she,'" Wilde said. "I've never seen anyone say that about a guy. And if he is with his kid, he's a fucking hero."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=103 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Meanwhile, Styles praised Wilde for her passion on the set of Don't Worry Darling. "As a director, Olivia is incredibly focused. She communicated what she was looking for from the cast with both clarity and respect," he told the outlet of his girlfriend. "I think transitioning from acting into directing has made her a director who knows how to get the best out of everyone."</p><h2 data-node-id=104 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">September 5, 2022: Olivia and Harry make their red-carpet debut at the Don't Worry Darling world premiere.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=105 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The couple attended the international premiere of Don't Worry Darling at the 79th Venice International Film Festival, where they appeared with cast members Florence Pugh, Gemma Chan, Sydney Chandler, and Chris Pine. They also attended a press conference ahead of the screening.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=106 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">During the events, they appeared to keep attention on the film rather than their relationship, standing apart during group photos.</p><img alt='"don&#39;t worry darling" red carpet 79th venice international film festival' title='"Don&#39;t Worry Darling" Red Carpet - 79th Venice International Film Festival' width=4000 height=2666 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gemma-chan-harry-styles-sydney-chandler-director-olivia-news-photo-1662402906.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Daniele Venturelli</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><h2 data-node-id=108 class="css-p3fpzg emevuu60">September 8, 2022: Olivia slams rumors that she left ex Jason Sudeikis for Harry.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=109 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In a new interview with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2022/09/cover-story-olivia-wilde-dont-worry-darling data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Vanity Fair" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Vanity Fair</a>, Wilde spoke candidly about the public speculation on her relationship with Styles starting before her relationship with Sudeikis ended.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=110 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"The complete horseshit idea that I left Jason for Harry is completely inaccurate," she said. "Our relationship was over long before I met Harry. Like any relationship that ends, it doesn't end overnight. Unfortunately, Jason and I had a very bumpy road, and we officially dissolved the relationship towards the beginning of the pandemic. We were raising two kids during lockdown, so we co-parented through that time. Once it became clear that cohabitating was no longer beneficial for the children, it became the responsible thing to not, because we could be better parents as friends who live in different houses."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=111 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She also lamented the barrage of criticism she's received from women who assume that she neglects her kids every time paparazzi capture photos of her and Styles.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=112 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I've had women judging me for separating from Jason. There are people who feel entitled to hurl horrendous insults at me and my family. Telling me I'm a terrible mother. Threatening me and my kids or saying I should lose my children," she said, adding that Sudeikis shares equal custody of their children. "When they are with their father, I trust him to be a great parent. So when they're not with me, I continue to live my life. But the judgment I've seen from people for living my life … I was like, 'Why are these women finding pleasure in this moment? Is it because it somehow makes them feel better about their lives, judgments, and choices without ever wondering why I might have made those choices?'"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=113 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Also in the interview, Wilde praised her boyfriend's willingness to take risks on the set of Don't Worry Darling.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=114 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"My thing with Harry was that I knew he was fearless," she said. "I'd rather work with a non-actor who's fearless than a trained actor who is full of hang-ups and baggage and judgment. What I love about working with singers and dancers is they commit 100 percent because, as a dancer, if you don't commit 100 percent, you get hurt. With singers, it's the same. If they sing at 30 percent, that song doesn't work. I think actors sometimes think they can get away with 30 percent."</p><h2 data-node-id=115 class="css-p3fpzg emevuu60">September 19, 2022: Olivia and Harry go to the after-party for the NYC premiere of Don't Worry Darling.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=116 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The couple made a sophisticated appearance for the premiere of Don't Worry Darling in New York City.
