Many of us, particularly those who work in the fashion industry, are sceptical about celebrity-owned brands – no matter how successful or lucrative they are. There is an assumption that it is all hype and no substance, that it is merely an attempt to line their pockets further with no consideration of the customer.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">So, despite the fact that I would actually consider myself a fan of Kim Kardashian West (and yes I have seen every episode of Keeping Up), I definitely still had reservations when it came to trying out her underwear label – despite the face that the reality star is responsible for creating several multi-million-dollar businesses.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And so, when I was offered the chance to try a set from Kardashian West’s shapewear and lingerie label Skims, I wasn’t expecting much – but I was pleasantly surprised. In fact, I couldn’t have been more wrong. I found Skims to be some of the most comfortable and supportive underwear I have ever worn.</p><img alt=skims title=skims width=1361 height=2041 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/skims-fits-everybody-3-1617116443.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Skims</span></p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The set I tried was from the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://skims.com/collections/bras#fits%20everybody data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Fits Everybody range" data-vars-ga-product-id=6a951e44-00e7-49fd-a8e6-03701a20fbb4 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://skims.com/collections/bras#fits%20everybody data-product-url=https://skims.com/collections/bras#fits%20everybody data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X618962&url=https%3A%2F%2Fskims.com%2Fcollections%2Fbras%23fits+everybody" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=9a2a08e2-27c6-4e18-bed6-b59913bbdb15 class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Fits Everybody range</a>. The briefs were super soft and hugged my hips perfectly – so far, so good – but it was the non-wired bralette that really impressed, giving me as much lift and support as I would expect from a wired bra. As a woman with a bigger bust, it's a struggle I'm all too familiar with; it's very difficult to find non-wired bras that offer enough support, particularly at this price point.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It turns out that the Fits Everybody range is Skims’ top-selling underwear – and its popularity is down to all the reasons that I loved it.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“In a way, we wanted to create anti-underwear,” a brand representative at Skims told me about the set I tried. “These are pieces that are so comfortable, you don’t even notice you are wearing them. The Fits Everybody range is made from a seamless, extremely stretchy fabric that perfectly moulds to every single body without digging, pinching or rolling. It’s our top-rated underwear for a reason.”</p><img alt=skims title=skims width=1632 height=2448 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/skims-fits-everybody-1-1617116501.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Skims</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She added that it is the “breathable and shaping power mesh” used in the bra that gives the support that you couldn’t usually achieve from a non-wired style.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“The fabric is so soft and stretchy, it just hugs your body in a really unique way,” she explains. “The lightweight material perfectly moulds to your curves, so you can wear these pieces under anything.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Kardashian West explains that with this range, she set out to create something that would feel like “bespoke underwear” to every woman that wears it.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I could never find underwear that was comfortable or soft enough, or that didn’t dig,” she tells me. “I wanted to create a solution to that, which is how we came to develop Fits Everybody. This is truly the best underwear I have ever worn – it’s made from a buttery soft fabric that stretches to over twice its size while never losing shape – it just springs back and moulds to your body. We’ve innovated the material across all of our nine sizes, so it really feels like bespoke underwear made just for you. I love it and I honestly wear it every single day.”</p><img alt=skims title=skims width=2910 height=2182 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/skims-fits-everybody-4-1617116536.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Skims</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Achieving the level of comfort and the support that is at the heart of these products comes from months and months of back and forth, Kardashian West explains.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Comfort has always been my main priority and drives initial decisions on fabric and fit, as well as whether or not a product is ultimately ready to launch. If there needs to be further development or revisions, we will always take the time to do that so the fit and feel are perfect by the time they reach the customer.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Of course, Fits Everybody is not Skims’ only product range, with each attempting to offer a different solution. The shapewear, for example, has been developed in an innovative way using a highly technical fabric that aims to enhance curves by offering targeted support in a nuanced way, rather than flattening a body like traditional shapewear did. The brand is constantly experimenting with fabric and fit to offer the best support.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“We take extreme care to ensure every piece delivers on its promise and effectively solves a problem,” she adds. “If it’s not perfect, we don’t launch it.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Still feeling sceptical? Kardashian West has an answer for that.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I would encourage anyone who has doubts about Skims to try it! We stand behind everything we do with confidence and I’m so grateful that I am able to turn my experience and passion for undergarments into solutions that women all around the world are relying on to look and feel amazing.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://skims.com/collections/bras#fits%20everybody data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Skims’ Fits Everybody range is available to shop here" data-vars-ga-product-id=6a951e44-00e7-49fd-a8e6-03701a20fbb4 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://skims.com/collections/bras#fits%20everybody data-product-url=https://skims.com/collections/bras#fits%20everybody data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X618962&url=https%3A%2F%2Fskims.com%2Fcollections%2Fbras%23fits+everybody" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=9a2a08e2-27c6-4e18-bed6-b59913bbdb15 class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Skims’ Fits Everybody range is available to shop here</a>.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In need of some at-home inspiration? <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://hearst.emsecure.net/optiext/cr.aspx?ID=szpklLhpWonj6JnlBH3GzpALHvm1ZwMa0oU9UEP6sYg4RDPmqEfyeN1vIR80j83YlJMODbnaXySUsa" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sign up to our free weekly newsletter" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Sign up to our free weekly newsletter</a> for skincare and self-care, the latest cultural hits to read and download, and the little luxuries that make staying in so much more satisfying.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://hearst.emsecure.net/optiext/cr.aspx?ID=szpklLhpWonj6JnlBH3GzpALHvm1ZwMa0oU9UEP6sYg4RDPmqEfyeN1vIR80j83YlJMODbnaXySUsa" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="SIGN UP" rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink class="body-btn-link css-lihu0l emevuu60"><strong>SIGN UP</strong></a></p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Kim Kardashian and Kanye West at the 2019 Met Gala" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/1278bc7d-8b53-4822-9623-6a3d4513f4a0/thumb_1920x1080_00001_1557216901_54832.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwssCsn6KnnmSudIGYcHBwbmVkwKy1zKxkrqaUmr%2B4scCrZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
