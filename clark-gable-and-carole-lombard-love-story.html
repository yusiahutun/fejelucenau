Husband and wife loved spending time in nature—often hiking, camping, and hunting together—so naturally, they made their home on a 20-acre ranch in Encino, California, complete with horses, cows, and chickens. Whenever business took them apart, they would send each other silly presents ("goofy ones, strictly for laughs," wrote Ruth Waterbury in Photoplay), a tradition that had started at the wrap party for No Man of Her Own, when Lombard gave Gable a ham with his picture on it. Their house was filled with gag gifts for such occasions.</p><img alt="Clark Gable, Carole Lombard," title="Gable and Lombard" width=1024 height=784 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/clv.h-cdn.co/assets/17/13/1490740363-gable-lombard-hollywood-ranch-1938.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1lk26yx e6iqukd2">Getty Images</span><p>The couple at home on their ranch.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">But the handsome, fun-loving duo had their fair share of dark times too.

Before leaving Hollywood, she and her mother, Elizabeth Peters, visited a psychic they occasionally saw for fun. The woman shook her head when she read Lombard's fortune: "Keep out of planes in 1942," she allegedly warned. "There is danger in them for you."</p><h6 class="css-5zz7ok e6pr2lz3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e6pr2lz1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">On the Indianapolis trip, Lombard was accompanied by her mother and Otto Winkler, Gable's press agent and longtime friend, who'd been with the couple when they eloped. Gable had asked him to assist Lombard on the journey. On the day they were to return to California, both Otto and Lombard's mother tried to talk her out of flying. Winkler had experienced a premonition of a plane crash just days before, according to the Post, and was concerned about flying in winter conditions. Peters had the psychic's words on her mind.</p><img alt="Photograph, Motor vehicle, Classic, Snapshot, Retro style, Vintage clothing, Photography, Vehicle, Car, Stock photography, " title="Photograph, Motor vehicle, Classic, Snapshot, Retro style, Vintage clothing, Photography, Vehicle, Car, Stock photography, " width=833 height=1024 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/clv.h-cdn.co/assets/17/13/1490801053-gable-lombard-break-1940.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1lk26yx e6iqukd2">Getty Images</span><p>On a break from filming, circa 1940.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=43 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">But Lombard had scored last-minute seats on TWA Flight 3, desperate to get back and fix things with the man she called "Pappy" and "Mr. G." They decided on a coin toss to settle the dispute, and Lombard won. After a stop in Las Vegas to refuel, she, her mother, and Winkler lost their lives later that day en route to Los Angeles when their plane crash landed on Nevada's Potosi Mountain.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=45 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Gable was devastated. He had been so proud of his wife, who had raised more than $2 million in bonds during her week away, and was excited to pick her up at the airport. When he learned of the news, he flew out to Nevada with Winkler's wife and a few others, and demanded that he be allowed to visit the wreckage himself.
