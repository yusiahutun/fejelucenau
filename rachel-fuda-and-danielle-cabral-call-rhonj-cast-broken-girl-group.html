It's like a little sorority."</p><p>"And how many people knew us. I'm like, 'Hi, I'm Danielle.' They're like, 'We know who you are.

In all fairness. I'm not even thinking about the reunion, that's probably like six, seven months down from here," she added. "We just got over Halloween and now it's Christmas season. I'm very excited and I'm very excited that we're here at BravoCon, with all the fans and we're just having a good time."</p><p>For more from BravoCon, check out the gallery below.</p><a id=gallery-link-73945b91-7afe-475c-8e39-4cc213d89c81 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:73945b91-7afe-475c-8e39-4cc213d89c81 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:50efbc45-ac32-4fba-8778-8810d69defe2 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/e8/4by3/2023/11/04/e863ab687a314901b2f338e1f8002189_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGpmaW5fp66ktMSlZJ%2BtlJZ6orrDZpuappmaua2xjJyYm6qRoXqkrculZKugn6O3bq%2FArKtmmqKkuKa6jKCgq6RdnL%2Bwwc9o</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
