Forget that movie you were going to watch during your lunch break or plane ride, now you're in survival mode, waiting for that important text, call, or email to come through while your phone still has any life left.</p><p>Benks' MagClap On-Go Power Bank attaches to the back of your MagSafe-compatible iPhone, giving it the juice it needs to stay powered on throughout the day. And if you have an Android or an older iPhone, you can use the included adhesive magnetic ring to take full advantage of this portable power bank's magnetized capabilities.</p><h2 id=design-smooth-and-simple>Design: Smooth and Simple</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/8ed6f8c7.jpg> Marcus Mears III / Review Geek <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><ul><li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 3.78 x 2.52 x 0.5in (96 x 64 x 12.5mm)</li><li><strong>Exterior finish:</strong>&nbsp;Liquid silicone</li><li><strong>Port:</strong> USB-C PD</li><li><strong>Weight:</strong> 8.8oz (249.48g)</li></ul><p><a href=#>Power banks</a> are usually pretty plain, offering an on/off switch and LED indicators to denote the remaining power level. The MagClap On-Go follows suit in this area with a few key differences, the first of which is its silicone exterior.</p><p>Benks' MagSafe power bank comes in five colors: Black (as reviewed), Dark Blue, White, Purple, and Light Blue---all of which offer a sleek silicone finish that feels smooth and cool to the touch. The second difference between the MagClap On-Go and your run-of-the-mill portable power bank is the inclusion of MagSafe magnets---these keep the charger adhered to the back of your smartphone while it charges, meaning you aren't hindered by a cord or stuck next to an outlet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"So if I don't have a MagSafe-compatible iPhone, this is just a normal power bank?" Not quite; Benks included an adhesive magnetic ring that you can stick to the back of your Android or older iPhone. As long as your phone is compatible with&nbsp;<a href=#>Qi wireless charging</a>, you can use the magnetic ring in a pseudo-MagSafe capacity.</p><p>As with any <a href=#>MagSafe charger</a>, the only caveat to this is it probably won't work if you use anything other than an ultra-thin case (or a <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">certified MagSafe-compatible case</a>).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/2e0b44f3.jpg> Marcus Mears III / Review Geek<p>And, of course, if you'd rather power up faster and don't mind using a cord, you can make use of the MagClap On-Go's USB-C port for 12W of charging rather than the 7.5W that wireless charging offers. The portable power bank only comes with a USB-C to USB-C cable (which you can use to recharge the power bank itself), so you'll need a <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">USB-C to Lightning connector</a> if you plan to use wired charging on an iPhone. You'll also need to pick up a <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">USB-C wall adapter</a> to charge the power bank if you don't already have one.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At&nbsp;3.78 x 2.52 x 0.5in, Benks' portable charger is roughly the size of a credit card with some extra thickness. This makes it perfect for slipping into pockets, purses, bags, or car cupholders for a recharge wherever and whenever you need it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/21q6yrxyyel-_sl500_.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title>Apple iPhone 14 Silicone Case with MagSafe - Midnight</h5>$45 <span class=regular-price>$49</span> Save $4<p class=display-card-description>Protect your iPhone without sacrificing the benefits of MagSafe charging.</p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">$45 at Amazon</a><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">Best Buy</a><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">Target</a><h3 id=adhesive-magnetic-ring-not-as-good-as-magsafe>Adhesive Magnetic Ring: Not as Good as MagSafe</h3><span class=txt>Close</span><p>This is a great addition if you're an Android user or haven't upgraded your Apple handset since the iPhone 11.</p><p>All you have to do is pull out the included adhesive ring, peel off the paper, and stick it to the back of your phone.

The iPhone had <a href=#>Low Power Mode</a> enabled and underwent light, mixed-use consisting of a few YouTube videos, Slack message checking, and Amazon order tracking while charging.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The charger stayed cool to the touch the entire time in this mode. The power bank still had around 50% battery remaining (2 LEDs), so you could charge your iPhone from 0 to full off of a full-capacity MagClap On-Go before you need to plug the portable charger back in again.</p><p>With the MagSafe method, as opposed to wired, it took 2 hours and 13 minutes to charge my iPhone from 50% to 100%. I noticed a little heat buildup when using the wireless charging mode, though this is the case with nearly every wireless charger. The silicone exterior kept the charger relatively cool, and the warmth was far from worrying.</p><p>The iPhone 13's battery capacity is 3,227mAh. If your phone has a lower capacity, you'll likely get more use out of the MagClap On-Go Power Bank before needing to charge it.</p><p>Again, you could get about one full charge of your iPhone before needing to plug the MagClap On-Go in for charging.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><p>Can I use the MagClap On-Go Power Bank with Androids and non-MagSafe-compatible iPhones?</p><p>-</p><p>Absolutely.

It's stylish, effortless to transport, and charges your phone pretty quickly. With the added benefit of magnetic adhesion, whether your smartphone is MagSafe-compatible or not, you can continue to check your email, play mobile games, and respond to texts without being tied down by a charging cable.</p><p>However, if you just want to charge your phone while out and about and don't need magnets, save some money and go with a power bank like the <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Anker PowerCore Slim 10K</a>. With a 10,000mAh battery compared to the MagClap On-Go's 5,000mAh, you're getting double the capacity at nearly half the price. While not as convenient as a MagSafe alternative (especially if you forget a charging cable), you'll get considerably more bang for your buck.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you're an Apple Watch user and want a MagSafe charger that stays at home, consider the <a href=#>Nomad Base One Max</a>.
