They dated for a while and entered into a marriage in 2006. Their second marriage outlasted the first one by two years when it finally broke up in 2014. According to Jillian, the divorce was amicable and was attributed to insurmountable differences.</p><p>While her relationship with Grant continued, Jillian changed her legal name to Jillian Reynolds, but she still used Barberie for professional reasons. In December 2006, news surfaced that Jillian was pregnant with her first child by the former sniper who became an actor.</p><p>On July 6, 2007, Jillian was delivered by a girl named Ruby Raven Reynolds. Her second child is a boy named Rocco Rio Reynolds who was born on January 11, 2010. But while the world waited for the possible news of their third issue together in 2013, Jillian announced that she and Grant would end it. She filed for divorce the same day she made the announcement, and the divorce was finalized the following year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Jillian-with-Family.jpg><p>After that, there was a custody battle between them. Jillian wanted custody of her two children and visitation rights for Reynold, and they should both share legal fees. Eventually, she got what she wanted: she gets custody of the children while Grant helps her raise them.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Is Jillian Barberie Still Married or Dating Anyone?</strong></h2><p>Since her marriage to Grant Reynolds ended in 2014, we haven’t heard that Jillian Barberie has become addicted again.

This is different from her life before the children were born.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Bethany Joy Lenz Married, Husband, Daughter, Body Measurements</a></strong></p><p>In the past, she had a number of dates besides her two ex-husbands.
