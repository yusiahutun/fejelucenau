Abducted by Philip and his wife, Nancy Garrido, she was routinely tormented and was also given a whole new image: Alyssa. The wicked duo grabbed her as she walked to the bus stop when she was just 11 years old. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-606 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p style=text-align:justify>Philip, the husband and one of the captors, was found guilty of rape and torture after repeatedly forcing himself on her. For the following 18 years, she was subjected to horrific suffering at the claws of the Garridos. During her bondage, she had two children: Starlet and Angel.</p><h2 dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>Jaycee Lee Dugard: A Look Back in Time</h2><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>She had to go through all of the torture while also becoming a mother at a young age, all while imprisoned in an old bunker in Garrido's yard. In addition to these inhumane acts, she was also forbidden from connecting with the outside world and was given countless lies. Her journal was her sole company while she was left in the dark in that horrible pit.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>All she did was keep notes of her fears, sadness, and lack of real connection overall. Given her concerns for her family and dreams of being free one day, Dugard gradually began to lose trust in her family's love for her. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>It's not that she didn't try to flee from her captors' clutches; she did, but it was difficult for her since her children were involved. Yet, despite those false ways, she was still a mother to two children. Thankfully, her misery came to an end in August 2009, when the two abusers were convicted of rape and false arrest, as well as 27 other criminal offenses.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Jaycee's Life Now: Marriage And Current Whereabouts</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Dugard has been currently living a decent life with her parents for over a decade. That being said, she has yet to marry anyone. A mother who loves her children and wants the best for them aspires for her girls to be independent, make their own choices, and appreciate spending leisure time with her two kids. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Also Not Married:-&nbsp;</strong><a href=# title="Riley Lewis Age 15 Not Married But Dating Boyfriend, TikTok Star Tyler Philips" rel=follow>Riley Lewis Age 15 Not Married But Dating Boyfriend, TikTok Star Tyler Philips</a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p style=text-align:justify>Despite the fact that she was robbed of her high school education, the mother prioritized educating her kids. As a result of her commitment, both of her children have now enrolled in colleges.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Jaycee Lee Dugard (center) with&nbsp;Julie Johnston Ertz (right) and&nbsp;Rebecca Bailey (left) in May 2019 </strong>(Photo: Jaycee Lee Dugard's Twitter) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>After being away from her home environment and being accustomed to solitude, Dugard learned how to adjust to the contemporary world. She now possesses the necessary day-to-day abilities, including driving, writing checks, grocery shopping, and a range of other jobs. She has grown along since she does not wish to remain trapped in the old times.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Inspiring Millions:-&nbsp;</strong><a href=# title="'WCVB' Maria Stephanos Bio: Amazing Husband & Family Journey, Inspiring!" rel=follow>'WCVB' Maria Stephanos Bio: Amazing Husband & Family Journey, Inspiring!</a></p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>She is only concerned with her children's lives and their prospects. Nevertheless, she has managed to publish her own work, such as her memoirs A Stolen Life and Freedom: My Book of Firsts, and she has now become a source of inspiration for the rest of the globe. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify>She also started the organization Just Ask Yourself to Care, which supports survivors of captivity and bullying. The foundation also helps police officers, victims of natural disasters, military personnel, and a variety of other individuals who have been touched by tragic incidents.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-655></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmauys63MqaypZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZqOZqZiypnnLnpxmnKWcrrOwjKaYq6qZmrFur8eio52qlaN6sa3RnqWtq16dwa64</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
