"Where's that?" they asked, looking blankly at me as I explained its proximity to Lake Maggiore and Lake Como. I could see what they were thinking; why not just go there? After all, these two famed locations have long held mastery over Northern Italy's lake region, dotted with luxury hotels, restaurants and the odd Clooney (or four). They had me worried that I had chosen their poor relation. This concern was dispelled the minute I arrived.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Lake Orta is roughly an hour's drive from Milan airport, in the Piedmonte region of undulating vineyard-dappled hills and alpine lakes. As our car snaked through leafy copses, shots of azure waters began to emerge. You quickly realise the lake - the smallest in the area - is picture-perfect from every angle. It is not clogged with buildings but mostly embraced by greenery and the odd smattering of houses, meaning its (still) vast expanse of blue feels idyllic. We were heading to its main town, Orta San Giulio, which sits on a peninsula with a direct view of the lake's only island, the tiny and picturesque Isola San Giulio.</p><img alt="orta san giulio" title="Orta San Giulio" width=900 height=560 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/4985-1-1642087123.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy</span><p>Orta San Giulio</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Orta San Giulio is, quite simply, a film set. Faded frescos adorn the walls and each building is painted in Italy's traditional salmon and ochre hues, with stone balconies and peeling shutters. Cobbled squares beget winding streets, each with narrow alleyways snaking off towards snapshots of the water. Steps, carved into the hill, twist upwards towards renaissance churches and ivy-wrapped villas behind wrought iron gates.</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for 10 of the best travel experiences in the world" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/screen-shot-2018-07-12-at-14-35-31-1531402547.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The main square, Piazza Motta, hosts a small harbour of boats that ferry to and from the island, and a collection of ice-cream parlours, chic restaurants (do check out both <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.ristorante-venus.it/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ristorante Venus" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Ristorante Venus</a> and <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="http://www.albergoleondoro.it/?lang=it" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Leon d'Oro" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Leon d'Oro</a>) and cafés. On our first day, we ate Italian charcuterie at <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.panevino-orta.it/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Pan & Vino" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Pan & Vino</a> in the piazza; a prime spot for both lunch and people-watching, as well as loading up on treats at their very well stocked store, groaning with truffles, wine, fresh pasta and olive oil.</p><img alt="lake orta" title="Lake Orta" width=1200 height=800 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/3t1a9700-modifica-1-1642086934.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy</span><p>Lake Orta</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Lake Orta's Piedmonte location means it is in one of Italy's premier gastronomical destinations. Piedmonte is the home of Barolo, of truffles, of innumerable special dishes like tajarin - a light, thin spaghetti- and ravioli del plin - pillowy pasta parcels filled with veal or pork and drenched in a roasted vegetable sauce. We gorged ourselves on the latter at <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.locandaorta.com/ristorante-la-terrazza/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Locanda di Orta" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Locanda di Orta</a>, a small hotel with undoubtedly one of the town's finest eateries. We dined at the Olive Terrace on the rooftop at sunset, which boasted views of the island and lake and was almost as diverting as the food itself.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Orta San Giulio is, quite simply, a film set<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It was an effortlessly romantic, almost clichéd, moonlit stroll back from dinner to our hotel. There are plenty of great accommodation options in Lake Orta (<a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://hotelsanrocco.it/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Hotel San Rocco" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Hotel San Rocco</a>, in the heart of Orta San Giulio, is a great shout, with a beautiful lakeside bar) but we had opted for the lake's most unique; <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.villacrespi.it/en/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Villa Crespi" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Villa Crespi</a>. Once a private home, built in 1879 in Moorish style by a Milanese businessman, it is now a 14-room <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.relaischateaux.com/gb/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Relais & Chateaux" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Relais & Chateaux</a> hotel, set in private gardens overlooking the lake. Each room is breathtakingly decorated like a palatial suite, with huge windows and a proliferation of antique furniture, and every guest is treated with a warm, almost royal reverence, perfectly suited to its sumptuous decor A stay here really does feel like slipping back in time, in the best possible way.</p><img alt="villa crespi" title="villa crespi" width=800 height=531 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/webimage-f8693093-6a79-40f5-9b64d8b59a0d816d-1635154404.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy</span><p>Villa Crespi</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Villa Crespi contains a 2 Michelin Star restaurant, by Italian celebrity chef (and co-owner - it's a husband and wife run operation) Antonino Cannavacciuolo, which means the hotel is also a local hotspot, with a gorgeous bar and sun-drenched terrace that served us particularly well for our breakfast the next day, after a refreshing 7am dip in the lake.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">That day we took a boat out to Isola San Giulio. It is easy to book a private charter, which can take you to any number of the small towns and villages around the lake, or to hop on the water bus, which leaves roughly every 15-30 minutes from Piazza Motta. The island is dubbed 'the island of silence' thanks to the still-functioning monastery which dominates. Though you cannot peek inside, you can visit the main basilica, and visitors are encouraged to take the 'walk of silence' (easily signposted) around the island. Think of it as a medieval meditation app.</p><img alt="isola san giulio" title="Isola San Giulio" width=1558 height=969 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/crespi-exp5-1642087231.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy</span><p>Isola San Giulio</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There are plenty of quirky art and crafts shops on the island, selling local pottery and paintings, and browsing through the unique, narrow paths will eat up a pleasant morning, which you can then follow with lunch at the gorgeous <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.ristorantesangiulio.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ristorante San Giulio" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Ristorante San Giulio</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Just above Orta San Giuilio is <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.sacrimonti.org/sacro-monte-di-orta data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sacro Monte" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Sacro Monte</a>, an old pilgrimage site and religious community that dates back to 1583 and is populated with 20 chapels, various statues and shrines. It is a short, but steep, walk uphill and is worth the sweaty ascent for the site's calm beauty and breathtaking views. Save yourself the perspiration, and head up for just before sunset, when the area is lit up magically and you can watch the sun dip below beautiful Lake Orta. Who needs Como after all?</p><img alt="lake orta san giulio" title="Lake Orta San Giulio" width=1200 height=800 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/orta-san-giulio-village-1-1642087048.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy</span><p>Orta San Giulio</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwwNGarZ6kX5aAeISRbHBua1%2BhrqyxjKiprZldqb%2BiwsSlZKCtmZmycA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
