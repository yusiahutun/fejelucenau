When the divorce happened, it was the first time I felt I lost my equilibrium… It was scary and sad and made me pull everything into focus. I needed to focus on what was important. So that’s who I am now because of that. I know regrets can be catalysts for good things."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5ec010e5dc16-gettyimages-139160788.jpg><p id=edTk8X3l5dy data-wc=46>He continued: "It’s sad and heartbreaking. I was separating not only from my wife but also my kids and the bonds of home and family. Those are things you’re painfully reminded of every day. It’s like, '[Expletive], what lesson is this? What’s to come from this?’"&nbsp;</p><h2>Does James Marsden have children?</h2><p id=eSpqxn_-8cuN data-wc=55>The pair share two children, Mary James Marsden, 17, and Jack Holden Marsden, 22.

It is the most fulfilling. I’m always self-deprecating, but I don’t have a problem saying that I am a great dad."&nbsp;</p><p id=eCj4tYar8u data-wc=13><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Jury Duty: where is Ronald Gladden now since taking part in show?</a></strong></p><p id=etRC_mwEsd data-wc=14><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Jury Duty cast: Who are they and where have you seen them before?</a></p><p id=eMx5leq8pYp5 data-wc=65>While Jack has worked as a model, and now describes himself as a producer, musician and engineer on Instagram, James has revealed that his daughter is interesting in acting, saying: "A little bit.

I wouldn't discourage them for sure."&nbsp;</p><h2>Who is James Marsden dating now?&nbsp;</h2><p id=eiqocfXNxnz9 data-wc=50>James is currently dating British singer-songwriter Emma Deign, who is perhaps best known by her stage name, Edei.
