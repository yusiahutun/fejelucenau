Along with his success in the industry, one can't help but notice the changes in his appearance throughout the years. While some attribute it to his age, his consistently stunning looks may also be the result of his healthy lifestyle. However, many speculate that Ryan Reynolds’ plastic surgery may also have played a role.&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, Reynolds himself has admitted to undergoing surgery, but not for cosmetic reasons. In an old interview, he recounted a scary experience where he fainted for the first time in his life while walking through the bathroom in his house, resulting in a head injury. He got plastic surgery to fix it and joked that, as an actor, getting work done is part of the job description. The Green Lantern star explained, “I fainted for the first time in my life. I don’t know what happened. I was walking through the bathroom in my house, I went down, I smashed my head open, blood poured everywhere, and then I got plastic surgery to fix it. I’m an actor, we’re supposed to (get it) anyway…”</p><p>As for future cosmetic enhancements, it's too early to tell if Reynolds has plans to pursue them. There is talk that his wife, Blake Lively, has undergone plastic surgery in the past. Whether or not Reynolds will join her remains to be seen.</p><h2><strong>Ryan Reynolds’ Hair Transplant</strong><strong>: Is It True?</strong></h2><p><img alt="Ryan Reynolds Plastic Surgery" title="Ryan Reynolds Plastic Surgery" width=333 height=500 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-10/1696567676_shutterstock_376302244-1.jpg></p><p>The internet has been buzzing with rumors that Ryan Reynolds has undergone a hair transplant. Some sources claim that the Deadpool star was unhappy with his thinning hairline and opted for the popular cosmetic procedure. But are the rumors true?&nbsp;</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p>Well, let's dive into the evidence. Firstly, let's take a look at some old photos of the actor from the early days of his career. Back then, Ryan Reynolds’ hairline was noticeably higher and he had much less hair volume than he does now. Based on his after photos, it is highly probable that he has sought help from a FUE (Follicular Unit Extraction) or a FUT (Follicular Unit Transplant) operation to restore his hair during those years. However, some people argue that this change in appearance could simply be due to good styling and makeup tricks.&nbsp;</p><p>While Reynolds has yet to publicly confirm or deny the hair transplant speculation, it's clear that he has gone through some hair transformation. Whether it was through natural hair growth or surgical intervention, one thing's for sure: Ryan Reynolds always manages to look handsome, hair or no hair.</p><h2><strong>Did Ryan Reynolds Get a Nose Job?</strong></h2><p><img alt="Ryan Reynolds Plastic Surgery" title="Ryan Reynolds Plastic Surgery" width=332 height=500 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-10/1696567677_shutterstock_103473071-1.jpg></p><p>There's a topic that's been on the minds of many fans lately: Did Ryan Reynolds undergo a nose job? We touched on this earlier and acknowledged that many people believe his nose appears to have changed, but is it a result of <a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Ryan Reynolds’ Plastic Surgery: Did the Deadpool Star Get Work Done? ","1248773","https://www.pinkvilla.com/beauty/makeup/madelyn-clines-plastic-surgery-1248313","articlepage","/beauty/makeup/ryan-reynolds-plastic-surgery-1248773","plastic surgery","Body_Hyperlink","beauty","makeup")'>plastic surgery</a> or just natural aging?</p><p>Our hunch is that it's the latter. When looking at photos of Ryan from his youth, the bridge of his nose seems thicker, which suggests that such changes may occur as a person grows older. It's not uncommon to see such differences when looking back at one's own old photographs.</p><p>Therefore, we're inclined to believe that Ryan has never had a rhinoplasty. It seems that his nose has simply matured over time, as many people's features do.</p><h2><strong>How Much Has Ryan Reynolds Spent On Plastic Surgery?</strong></h2><p>Since Ryan Reynolds hasn't been confirmed to have undergone plastic surgery, it's difficult to say for sure how much money he might have spent on it. Nonetheless, according to some sources, if he did undergo surgery, he could have spent anywhere from $10,000 to $50,000 on various procedures. These might include rhinoplasty to refine his nose, a facelift to smooth out wrinkles, or even Botox injections to maintain youthful-looking skin.</p><p>While some argue that his natural charm and good looks result from genetics and hard work, others claim that Reynolds' impeccable appearance can only be attributed to cosmetic enhancements. Whether he has actually undergone surgery or not, it's clear that the actor is dedicated to maintaining his appearance and consistently appears picture-perfect on the red carpet.</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><h2><strong>Ryan Reynolds’ Plastic Surgery:</strong><strong> Before And After Photos</strong></h2><p>Let's take a stroll down memory lane and analyze the actor's alleged journey through plastic surgery. By closely examining Ryan Reynolds' before and after photos, we can uncover the subtle enhancements he may have undergone during the years as he ascended to Hollywood stardom.</p><h3><strong>Before:</strong></h3><p><img alt="Ryan Reynolds Plastic Surgery" title="Ryan Reynolds Plastic Surgery" width=333 height=500 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-10/1696567677_shutterstock_84325204-1.jpg></p><p><img alt="Ryan Reynolds Plastic Surgery" title="Ryan Reynolds Plastic Surgery" width=329 height=500 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-10/1696567677_shutterstock_477525304-1.jpg></p><h3><strong>After:</strong></h3><p><img alt="Ryan Reynolds Plastic Surgery" title="Ryan Reynolds Plastic Surgery" width=411 height=500 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-10/1696567678_shutterstock_544581334-1.jpg></p><h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><p>While there is speculation about Ryan Reynolds’ plastic surgery, the truth is ultimately unknown.
