Eric is a lifelong New Yorker who has been a general contractor for more than 30 years. His first brush with fame on the network came during his time on </span><i><span>Brother vs. Brother</span></i><span> as a member of </span><a href=#><b>Drew Scott</b></a><span>’s team in 2014. He credited the competition show for being the first step in launching his successful career.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“I went to seven weeks, I was at the finale and I became runner-up,” the home improvement expert told </span><a href=#><span>Distractify</span></a><span> in September 2022. “But I also won because right after that I was chosen for general contractor for HGTV’s </span><i><span>Love It or List It</span></i><span>.”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Eric-Eremita-Net-Worth-How-Much-Money-HGTV-Star-Makes-1.jpg><p><span>Alongside Hilary and David, Eric proved to be a huge asset to the </span><i><span>Love It or List It</span></i><span> team. But in 2019, he announced that he was <a href=#>leaving the show</a>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“I always wanted my own show, to be very honest with you,” the TV personality said of his decision to move on and start a new chapter.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><b>How Else Does Eric Eremita Make Money?</b></h2><p><span>Eric is still working hard on making the dream of having his own renovation show come true. He and his pal </span><b>Conrad Layton</b><span> developed a show called </span><i><span>Homeboys</span></i><span> and are hoping it gets picked up by a major network. He gave fans a glimpse of his concept for </span><i><span>Homeboys</span></i><span> in a clip shared on TikTok in March 2023.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“It’s inspirational, part educational and it’s loaded with pop culture,” he wrote in the caption. “Not to mention funny and loaded with feel-good moments with a giving back element as well.”</span></p><p><span>In addition to his pursuit of a new TV venture, the craftsman started his own clothing line and is a doting dad to his three children, Mia, Eric Jr. and Evan, whom he shares with his wife, Joanne. His family was his support system when he battled COVID-19 in April 2020 which left him fighting for his life on a ventilator for two weeks.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“It puts the bigger picture in perspective, and what’s important to you in life and what’s not,” he told </span><a href=#><i><span>People</span></i></a><span> in May 2020 of what he learned from the experience. “Don’t sweat the small stuff, you know? It’s not worth it.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46eqaKbXZq%2FprnIrZhmppWperi70a2fZqCfrHquwcKhZKannprGbrTGra1mq6SWv265wKScrGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
