After several family members reached out saying something similar, a quick look on <a href=#>Reddit confirms</a> they're not the only ones.</p><p>One user on Reddit posted that someone keeps trying to reset their Facebook password, but thanks to two-factor authentication, the person received an email with a code. <a href=#>Looking through the Reddit thread</a>, a flood of these attempts has <a href=#>surfaced all week long</a>. However, just because you received an email that looks legit doesn't mean it's an actual email from Facebook.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>(Update: Resolved) This Facebook Glitch Automatically Sends Friend Requests to Strangers</a></span></p><p>The Facebook email reads: "We received a request to reset your Facebook password. Enter the following reset code," followed by a blue box with an 8-digit code. It also says, "Alternatively, you can directly change your password and offers up a one-click box to make the change. Don't click anything in the email.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another user <a href=#>reported that the email</a> was sent from security@facebookmail.com, an authentic address Facebook uses for security-related communications. Still, the flood of emails has users concerned, and hackers can spoof emails.</p><p>As usual, never click any buttons, links, or codes received in an email regarding passwords or login attempts, especially if you didn't request the code yourself. Be cautious!</p><p>Over the last few years, Facebook has <a href=#>slowly required two-factor authentication</a> for many accounts, which could save users by sending an email code before allowing for a reset. And while 2FA is a second layer of security, it's <a href=#>not without its flaws</a> either.</p><p>Judging by the countless replies on Reddit and complaints on Facebook, there appears to be a widespread phishing attempt going on at the moment. If you decide to change your password, ignore the email and manually change it within the Facebook app. Furthermore, using&nbsp;<a href=#>a password manager</a>&nbsp;to secure your online accounts is always a good idea.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We've reached out to Facebook and will report back once we know more.</p><p>via <a href=#>Reddit</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGhobnFhaIFwssCcnJunn6B6tr%2FEq6pmmaKaeqOxyKeeZp6cpLylscNmmbJlkZiwsMHNrWSrnZOkw6a%2B2GacppmZocBw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
