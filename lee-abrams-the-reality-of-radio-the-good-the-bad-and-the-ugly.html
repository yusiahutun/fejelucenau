Overly dramatic maybe, but there are a lot of red flags that need to be addressed. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span class=s2>MERGERS, WALL STREET, THE ECONOMY AND ACQUISITIONS</span><span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></strong></p><p><span class=s2>If you observe the radio business, the conversation is focused almost exclusively on the economic side. That’s great…this is America. But—when was the last time you heard or read about a radio content war, or a station that’s tearing up a market with a new sound? Content brilliance needs to be part of the conversation. If the excitement in radio is all about the deals, where does that leave the listener who could care less about who owns who? Death by deal is a real possibility as media’s eye is SO far off the content ball, that we simply can’t compete to win in the Google/Apple era. The business side is what makes it rock, but content is what makes it roll, and you need both. Deals will be done, but it’s the magic that comes out of the speakers and screens that’ll move things forward, and that needs to be the conversation every bit as much as the economics.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span class=s2>THE PLAYBOOK HASN’T BEEN UPDATED IN 40+ YEARS&nbsp;</span></strong><span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=s2>I heard a “new” Rock station recently and they presented;&nbsp;</span><br><span class=s2>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span><span class=s2>–A “big voice” yelling at you about how hard they rock (that worked in 1979 when rock stations needed to re-enforce their manhood against the disco invasion….but that’s over)&nbsp;</span><span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=s2>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span><span class=s2>–Star Wars laser sound effects complete with ‘man in the box’ filtered effect. (The Empire was destroyed in the 70’s…time to move on..if radio is “theater of the mind” I heard theater of the lame)&nbsp;</span><span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=s2>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span><span class=s2>–Blocks, Two-fers, commercial free sets (Another relic of the 70’s. That was 40 years ago)&nbsp;</span><span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span><br><span class=s2>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span><br><span class=s2>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span><span class=s2>–Lunch. Not sure if it was a retro lunch, an electric lunch or whatever, but it was a “lunch”&nbsp;</span><span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=s2>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span><span class=s2>–A station van. Cool in ’71 when hippies carried their pot and guitars in vans, now a soccer mom symbol that defines not cool drives a van&nbsp;</span><span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=s2>&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span><span class=s2>–DJ’s selling Free Bird. (What can POSSIBLY be said about Free Bird in this day and age?)&nbsp;</span><span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=s2>The station was on 70’s focus group autopilot. We’re in the era where competition from other music sources is on steroids, but radio is in the “K108 plays more variety era. The Simpsons and Onion parody this stuff. Stations should install cliche buzzers—three buzzes and you’re fired. That should thwart “new” ideas like “The _ Lunch” </span><span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span><span class=s2>Of course this station was raving about how cool they were. Embarrassing.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span class=s2>THE STARS OF RADIO</span></strong></p><p><span class=s2>50’s- Deejays&nbsp;</span><br><span class=s2>60’s- PD’s&nbsp;</span><br><span class=s2>70’s- Consultants&nbsp;</span><br><span class=s2>80’s- Researchers&nbsp;</span><br><span class=s2>90’s- Group Heads&nbsp;</span><br><span class=s2>00’s-beyond —- Bankers and new media&nbsp;</span><span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=s2>God bless bankers, but we are in a creative crisis as much as an economic one. Time to recruit, enable and inspire creative content stars, and not just Talk hosts… but content creators. Radio seems to hire based on purely operational aptitude, driving those with heavy creative aptitude to other industries. That 19-year-old creative star will probably look at TV and Radio as the last place they’d want to be. This is a problem IF media has any interest in entering the content war. We have to make our media a creative oasis for thinkers to thrive. Read a job posting from any major traditional media company. Sounds like HR hell. Then read the Apple postings. Wonder why they get the future stars?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span class=s2>BALANCE NOT BULLSHIT&nbsp;</span><span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></strong></p><p><span class=s2>It is a content war out there and Apple/Google seem to have the advantage. But Radio and TV have the eyes and ears. Without a balanced people/function configuration, you’re doomed to lose. Need STARS in;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=s2>-Business&nbsp;</span><br><span class=s2>-Revenue&nbsp;</span><br><span class=s2>-Technology&nbsp;</span><br><span class=s2>-Operations and Creative.&nbsp;</span><span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=s2>I’m not talking about Morning Shows. I’m talking about creative leadership that, though actions and execution, create a creative priority that is equal to revenue priority. Working in sync to win the battle.&nbsp;</span><br><span class=s2>I recall waking into a TV station and seeing a mission statement in the lobby. It included lines about being cutting edge, innovating, leading, etc…. I asked the GSM if this was true. He smirked and said—Nope compete BS. Those statements exist throughout media.&nbsp;</span><br><span class=s2>When you hear “Content is King”…run! It’s not king.&nbsp;</span><br><span class=s2>Revenue is.&nbsp;</span><br><span class=s2>Content drives revenue.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=s2>Speaking of Bullshit. Stop with the old school slogans. No one believes them. Like in TV News–EVERY station is “Best, First, On Your Side, In It For You, Accurate….etc….. America is too BS savvy to buy that anymore.&nbsp;</span><span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span class=s2>DENIAL & ARROGANCE:</span></strong></p><p class=p1><span class=s2>You hear a lot of; </span><span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span><br><span class=s2>–Spotify only has a small share of listenership. Ha Ha&nbsp;</span><span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span><br><span class=s2>–Radio is great. When a tornado hits, you don’t go to Spotify (Maybe not yet, but then again, what about the 358 non tornadic days?)&nbsp;</span><span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span><br><span class=s2>–We’re #1&nbsp;</span><span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=s2>STOP! If you’re talking to Agencies and Wall Street…OK. BUT—internally….STOP!&nbsp;</span><span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span><span class=s2>This stuff sounds like General Motors in 1980.&nbsp;</span><span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span><span class=s2>We are at the most dramatic crossroad in Media History and to be self congratulating with denial and arrogance is frightening. It’s NOT OK…it’s war. You gotta pull out the weapons, kill the denial and start creating content that’ll win on 21st Century terms. The denial and arrogance is deafening. It’s worse in Radio/TV than newspapers where they still think it’s 1935.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span class=s2>THE DIGITAL EXCUSE&nbsp;</span><span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></strong></p><p class=p1><span class=s2>Digital is now…and the future. Pretty obvious. But–it’s often an excuse. A short cut that undermines the REAL issue—Dated and tired 80’s rooted content. If a station is tired and dull, a new App won’t magically make it great, but that’s the thinking out there.&nbsp;</span><span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=s2>You constantly hear how a product is “moving forward” and entering the digital space. Well, that’s simply survival. What is being avoided like the plague is the core product…the brand itself. Fix the product first. I recall being at a newspaper and they were raving about their innovations and it was stunning. But when I asked about the printed paper, I got blank stares and a “we can’t touch that…it’s sacred” response. Same thing in radio and TV.&nbsp;</span><span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span><span class=s2>WHAT COMES OUT OF THE SPEAKERS OR SCREEN is the problem that won’t be fixed by migrating it to online/mobile. Take TV News. It’s laughably dated with the Ultra Doppler super action weather, NORAD sets and big haired modern Ted Knight anchors. Will migrating that to Ipad save the day? Of course not. Fix the product first. Get the product in sync with 2020 before you start praying the delivery system will save you. Then there’s “interacting” with your radio. That’s great, but not at the expense of the listening experience. Listen first…then interact. No one wants to interact with something tired and increasingly irrelevant.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span class=s2>THE SECRET CONSPIRACY&nbsp;</span></strong><span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=s2>Seems there’s some secret law that says a Technology company can innovate daily. Version 2, Version 3, Upgrades, White iPhones, etc… Radio? Same playbook with new slogans. Even TV and Fashion has “New Fall Seasons”…radio is on innovation autopilot at a time when, to prosper in the Google/Apple era you need to innovate DAILY. American media is getting beaten by the Phone and Cable companies in terms of innovation. </span><span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span><span class=s2>That’s wrong.&nbsp;</span><span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=s2>Radio has become a stagnant commodity hoping a new App will fix everything at a time when Tech companies have embraced the 21st Century. This ain’t 1975 where you plug in a format and go. It’s a new world requiring constant updating.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span class=s2>BUT WE’RE LOCAL!&nbsp;</span><span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></strong></p><p class=p1><span class=s2>No you aren’t. Well, the WGN and WLW types breathe local, but most stations are generic. When I was a kid, we’d drive from Chicago to Miami on Holiday. Indy, Louisville, Nashville, Atlanta, Jacksonville, Miami. Every city had stations with character. Maybe it was the Southern accents on WQXI in Atlanta or the undeniable pride that permeated every break. Make that same trip today and it’s a generic wasteland. Everyone sounds the same. Again, you’ll hear the denial. we have a local morning show…we do a blood drive every summer. Big deal. Stations should do a “local audit”…audit their sound and marketing and you’d find hundreds of missed opportunities. In Chicago, there are several billboards and outdoor vehicles, I’ve yet to see ONE that says “Chicago’s W—-“…. Incidentally, “local” can be an excuse too. We are becoming more Global by the minute. But if you commit to local…then DELIVER in EVERYTHING that you touch.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s2>YOU CAN’T ABBREVIATE MAGIC&nbsp;</span><span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span><br><span class=s2>New station launches: “We have AM Drive, billboard, a tested library, some promos and an App—we’re good to go”&nbsp;</span><span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=s2>HUH??!! You can’t design the future until you understand the past. Look back to KHJ, KCBQ, THE LOOP, KFOG and scores of other ground breaking stations. They created a plan—completeness. Schwartzkopf style planning…a mission. Right down to how the receptionist answered the phone. Some say this/I’m old fashioned and you can’t do that today. Why? Is media so full of itself that a great game plan that REALLY reinvents is old fashioned? I’m one that believes ANY old media product can reinvent itself and kick ass in any market. Money? Imagination is free. In fact, the most passionate and gifted people are the ones you want in there, and they’re not about money. Of course media is driving them away. Winning media wars is hard. It takes emotional and managerial command. Media has to stop living in the Ad Club world and create teams that fight for brilliance…and deliver.&nbsp;</span><span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=s2>Todd Storz had a timeless line: “First program…then sell.”&nbsp;</span><span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=s2>Media is entertainment…not utility. In some cases both, but always entertainment. The environment is too cluttered to think call letters, history and an abbreviated game plan will win.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span class=s2>MEDIA & INFORMATION IS THE NEW ROCK N ROLL</span></strong></p><p><span class=s2>Rock and roll is arguably on life support as is music radio. It’s may not be apparent yet, but when it starts looking backwards, the best days are behind it. But that’s OK, you can learn from it and build on the NEW Rock n Roll. By Rock being dead, I mean as a driver of culture. Whereas Elvis drove culture, nowadays it’s Facebook…and News. The world is having a nervous breakdown and that’s what s moving the culture. I doubt if a new Beatles will emerge that make everything right…culture is all about media and information. BUT–The M.O. of Rock n Roll is timeless and we need Rock n Roll THINKING, regardless of format or style. The characteristics of Rock n Roll thinking include:&nbsp;</span><span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=s2>ECCENTRICITY…ALL THE WAY TO THE BANK&nbsp;</span><br><span class=s2>INNOVATION AS A DRIVER IN EVERYTHING YOU DO&nbsp;</span><br><span class=s2>ATTITUDE…A SPIRIT&nbsp;</span><br><span class=s2>SWAGGER…A SENSE OF CONFIDENCE&nbsp;</span><br><span class=s2>NEWNESS…THE STRUGGLE TO BE FIRST&nbsp;</span><br><span class=s2>BIG—MASS APPEAL&nbsp;</span><br><span class=s2>RE-INVENTION…A DESIRE AND MOTIVATION TO CREATES FANS NOT “USERS”&nbsp;</span><br><span class=s2>POWERFUL…CULTURE MOVING&nbsp;</span><br><span class=s2>CHANGING…ALWAYS PUSHING FORWARD&nbsp;</span><br><span class=s2>COMPETITIVE…FIGHTING FOR SUCCESS&nbsp;</span><br><span class=s2>ARTFUL…CREATING COMMERCE THROUGH ART (ART IS NOT A BAD WORD UNLESS IT’S BAD ART)</span><br><span class=s2>INSTINCTIVE…NOT RELYING ON YESTERDAYS INFORMATION&nbsp;</span><br><span class=s2>REBELLIOUS…AGAIN, A FIGHTING SPIRIT INTELLIGENT…IN A MASS APPEAL WAY&nbsp;</span><br><span class=s2>NON ELITIST…FOR THE MASSES&nbsp;</span><span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span class=s2>SUMMARY:&nbsp;</span><span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></strong><br><span class=s2>Get back to the roots. What a listener/viewer hears and sees from the speakers, the screens and on the streets. Stop with the excuses—Everything will be fine when the economy improves…we have a new App…We’ve been here since 1942….we’re local because our tower is here. Radio has one incredible thing going for it—Reach. Everyone has a radio. Radio and TV are in a position of strength. Just imagine if EVERYone had a Mac. Do you think Apple would call it quits? Radio and TV have, as mediums, given up the content fight at a time when THE MAGIC OF WHAT COMES OUT OF THE SCREENS AND SPEAKERS is more powerful than ANY technology. Combined with technology, it’s untouchable. Time to get on war footing and start to create the magic on 2024 terms</span></p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaGpgZ4BwfZFoaHJnnJqybq3Bq5imq12ptaZ50Z6YpaGkrnqwsoyrmJ2hn2LBqbGMoKaonF2ptaZ5wZqbZpmemXq1tMRmrKCkqWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
