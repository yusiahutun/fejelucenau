Like other versions of Love Island, Love Island Australia starts with 10 or so singles who are invited to a villa on a tropical island with the hopes of finding love. Within moments of meeting each other, the contestants must couple up. As couples, the contestants are required to sleep in the same bed and complete challenges with each other, such as a classic Love Island game where they have to transfer food from their mouth to their partner’s. As the season continues, more contestants are invited to the villa, and islanders already there have to make a choice about whether to stay with their current partner or couple up with someone new.</p><p>Each week, there’s a re-coupling and the contestants who aren’t in a couple are sent home. In the end, the public votes for their favorite couple among the finalists, and the winner receives a cash prize. On Love Island Australia, that prize is 50,000 Australian dollars. However, the money doesn’t go to both members of the couple. It goes to one person at random. That person must then decide whether to share the money with their partner or keep it for themselves.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=where-is-love-island-australia-filmed>Where is Love Island Australia filmed?</h2><p>Where is Love Island Australia filmed? Love Island Australia season 5 was filmed in Mallorca, Spain, which is also where season 1 and 4 filmed. Season 2 filmed in Fiji while season 3 filmed in Byron Bay, New South Wales. Season 3 originally planned to film in Port Douglas, Queensland, but because of the current health crisis, production decided to stay in New South Wales.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=who-is-the-love-island-australia-host>Who is the Love Island Australia host?</h2><p>The Love Island Australia season 5 host is Sophie Monk, a singer, actress and model, who also hosted season 1, 2 and 3 of Love Island Australia. Monk was also the lead of The Bachelorette Australia season 3, a judge on Australia’s Got Talent and the winner of The Celebrity Apprentice Australia season 4.</p><p>“I’m so excited to be returning as host of Love Island Australia and with overseas holidays finally coming back into view, I can’t wait to return to beautiful Mallorca to see what’s in store for our brand-new Islanders,” Monk said in a statement to 9Now about season 4.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=who-is-the-love-island-australia-narrator>Who is the Love Island Australia narrator?</h2><p>The Love Island Australia season 4 narrator is Stephen Mullen, a comedian who also narrated season 3.&nbsp; Seasons 1 and 2 of Love Island Australia were narrated by Eoghan McDermott McDermott who was also the host of The Voice of Ireland.</p><p>In an interview with the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Sydney Morning Herald</a> in 2021, Mullen explained how he became the narrator of Love Island Australia. “My agent sent me a message over the summer, asking was I interested in doing it, and honestly the first round of it I was like, yeah sure, it’ll be a bit of a laugh,” he said .”It was kind of like another voiceover job, and we just kept going through the rounds, there were a few different rounds of auditions and in the last one I had to write some jokes and had some fun doing it. It just happened like that – I can’t say I knew much about the show, to be honest with you.”</p><p>Mullen also told the publication that he didn’t know much about Love Island Australia until he became the show’s narrator but has since become obsessed with the series. “I definitely went down the YouTube rabbit hole on Love Island Australia, and I feel like I got to know the characters a bit more from Season One and Season Two. I feel like they were two very different seasons, the first one there were punch-ups and everything: it reminded me of that Aussie Rules game. But the second season seemed to be the charming Australian side, and I really enjoyed a lot of the characters,” he said. “I really enjoyed Adam, he came across to me like a genuine bloke. But then he fell in love with this girl Cartier, who was really religious, a born-again Christian, and my dad was a preacher so I know those types of people. I found those guys fascinating.”</p><p>He also explained how he sees Love Island Australia contestants more as characters to write his narrations. “I think over the course of the period when you’re spending time with them every day, you’re going to have a relationship with these characters, you’re going to have feelings towards them like every audience member would,” he said. “They are characters because you’re constructing a story, but they’re also obviously human beings as well, and you definitely have to be nice as well. It’s all a bit of fun, but be nice as well.</p><p>He continued, “I find it can be hard to be nice, especially in stand-up: sometimes it can be hard to not be nasty, and to find an empathetic angle, and sometimes you have to check yourself and say, I’m just angry for angry’s sake, I’m getting an easy laugh there because I’m angry and I’m not doing anything unique there. I’ve had to change stuff in the past – that’s all part of the process of being a stand-up.”</p><p>Love Island Australia is available to stream on&nbsp;9Now with a <a rel="noopener nofollow" href=#>VPN</a>.
