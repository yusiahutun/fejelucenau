No. 1 they both have worked their asses off to become the stars they are,” LaPalme magazine’s owner and creative director revealed. “They are a total blast together and I love how Peta is constantly pushing herself to be better. They truly are the American dream. Two immigrants coming from different parts of the world, conquering the world.”</p><p>The couple most recently spent their romantic date night walking the red carpet for the magazine’s launch party. Maks and Peta celebrated their spring cover with a smooch — or many — as they posed for pics at the Sofitel Los Angeles in Beverly Hills.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/peta-murgatroyd-maksim-chmerkovskiy-le-palme-spring-issue-magazine4.jpg><p>The blonde beauty looked gorgeous as always in a soft pink pantsuit topped with a stunning blazer. Her hubby looked like a total stud as he donned jeans with a brown shirt and patterned matching suit jacket.</p><p>Maks and Peta have been proving they are marriage goals ever since they made their relationship official over two years ago. “I knew he was the one. There was something so electric between us that people will still tell me about to this day,” the superstar mama gushed in the caption of a post she shared in July 2018 commemorating the first anniversary of their union. “I love you @maksimc, this has been an incredible, outrageous year for us! I pray we are this happy for the rest of our lives. You’re everything I knew you were.” We just love them!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46mmKSrXZi1rrHRpKavq5uexm7DyKWjZpyfYq6vxdOhoKefXZu8s3nWop2eZaCawaJ5zK6poJmkp7y6sI4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
