Thankfully, you don't need to buy a brand-new interface. You can simply add new channels to the audio interface you already own.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=connect-an-external-preamp-to-your-interface-via-adat>Connect an External Preamp to Your Interface via ADAT</h2><p>Look at the rear of your audio interface. If you see an optical audio jack (pictured below), your interface is capable of running an additional 8 or 16 audio channels. All you need is an ADAT-compatible preamp unit, such as the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Focusrite Scarlett OctoPre</a> or <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Behringer ADA8200</a>. These products are specifically designed for audio interface expansion—ADAT isn't some hack or workaround; it's the "official" way to add channels to your interface.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/8.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The ADAT expansion system can carry eight channels of 24-bit audio at 44.1kHz or 48kHz resolution. As a result, the average ADAT preamp unit has eight discreet inputs for microphone and line-level signals. Budget and mid-range audio interfaces usually have a single ADAT input for eight-channel expansion. However, if your audio interface has a pair of ADAT inputs, you can buy two preamp units for 16-channel expansion.</p><p>If you need to record at 88.2kHz or 96kHz, an ADAT cable will only carry four audio channels. Most eight-channel preamps, barring some of the cheaper options, have two ADAT outputs to circumvent this limitation. But, if you want to take advantage of such a setup, you'll need an audio interface with two ADAT inputs. In any case, you probably don't need to record at 88.2kHz or 96kHz.</p><p>Setting up an external preamp is a semi-painless task. You'll need a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">digital optical cable</a> to facilitate the ADAT connection. If your preamp doesn't come with a digital optical cable, buy a cheap one—it doesn't impact your sound quality. Once everything's hooked up, set the preamp to the same sample rate as your interface. Then, open your audio interface's software control panel, set its clock source to "ADAT," and activate its digital audio channels. Check the owner's manual if additional instructions are needed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Inexpensive eight-channel preamps like the aforementioned <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Behringer ADA8200</a> cost about $250 and have a great "transparent" sound. A mid-range option like the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Focusrite Scarlett OctoPre</a> or <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Audient Evo SP8</a> gives you a much better build quality (which dictates the product's lifespan), plus an expanded I/O and some other handy features. You won't find any substantial improvements in sound quality below the $800 or $900 mark.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1483614059_img_725712.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title>Focusrite Scarlett OctoPre 8-channel Microphone Preamp</h5>$500 <span class=regular-price>$630</span> Save $130<p class=display-card-description>The Focusrite Scarlett OctoPre offers eight discreet preamps with XLR-1/4" TRS combo inputs, plus phantom power.

Two audio interfaces can be used simultaneously. It's a bit of a tricky process, and you shouldn't buy an extra audio interface for this purpose, but it's a good option for those who happen to own extra gear.</p><p>Most mid-range and high-end audio interfaces have a "standalone" operation mode. When in standalone mode, an interface doesn't need to be plugged into a computer. Also, importantly, it will output multichannel audio over ADAT. You just need a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">digital optical cable</a> to connect your two interfaces.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Setting an audio interface to standalone mode is a fairly easy task. The owner's manual will detail this process, but you can usually activate standalone mode from the "routing" section of your audio interface's software controller. Make sure that both interfaces are set to the same sample rate, and set the clock source of your primary interface to "ADAT." You may also need to dig through the routing options of your primary interface, as the expanded channel selection may be disabled by default.</p><p>Note that some audio interfaces do not support standalone operation. A great example is the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Behringer U-PHORIA UMC1820</a>, which has an ADAT output but cannot operate as a standalone unit. Read the manual, check the manufacturers' website, or do some Googling to figure it out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If neither of your audio interfaces support standalone mode, you'll have to rely on aggregation. Basically, both of the interfaces will be plugged into your computer, but they'll operate under a single audio device. Aggregation isn't ideal in situations that require live monitoring, as it greatly increases the latency of your audio system. Mac computers natively support aggregation, and Apple has a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">comprehensive guide</a> on the subject. Windows users need to set up aggregation in the third-party <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ASIO4ALL</a> driver.</p><h2 id=plug-a-mixer-into-your-audio-interface>Plug a Mixer Into Your Audio Interface</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/7-3.png><p>If you can't afford an external preamp unit, a desktop mixer is your next best option. Mixers are typically used to control live sound—they have multiple audio inputs (usually between 6 and 16), each with dedicated controls for volume, equalization, and effects. These inputs are summed down to a stereo output, which you can plug into your audio interface's microphone or instrument jacks.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately, there's a major downside to this setup. A mixer can't add discreet channels to your audio interface. Even if your mixer has 10 inputs, everything must be summed down to the left and right stereo channels, which will occupy two of your interface's inputs.</p><p>This limitation may be negligible in "studio" settings where you're recording one thing at a time. In other words, you can have all of your microphones or instruments hooked up to the mixer and simply mute the channels that aren't in use.</p><p>But if you're simultaneously recording multiple audio sources, a mixer isn't ideal. Everything that goes into the mixer will be combined and baked down to a stereo audio track on your computer. You'll have a hard time getting professional results, as you won't be able to go back and edit each individual microphone or instrument.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mixers are cheap. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Pyle six-channel mixer</a> regularly goes on sale for under $100, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Yamaha's 12-channel mixer</a> floats around the $400 range. Be sure to check Facebook Marketplace, as there are plenty of mixers on the secondhand market. If you only need instrument inputs, check out the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Franklin SS-6</a> switchable DI box, as it's far more compact than a mixer and may resolve signal noise or ground loop issues.</p><p>Note that some mixers, such as the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TASCAM Model 12</a>, can operate as both a standalone mixer and multichannel audio interface. A mixer with this functionality may replace your audio interface or act as an aggregate device when you need extra channels. And, in case you're wondering, some high-end mixers do include multichannel ADAT output, but they're several times more expensive than standalone ADAT preamp units.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1550586049_1026878.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title>Yamaha MG12XU 12-Input 4-Bus Mixer with Effects</h5><p class=display-card-description>Expand your audio interface with the Yamaha MG12XU 12-channel mixer.
