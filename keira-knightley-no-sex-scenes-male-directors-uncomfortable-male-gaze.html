Now that she's had two children, Kiera Knightley is reconsidering her stance on filming sex scenes, and nude scenes in general. And one place she's settled is that she's no longer willing to do any of them if the director is male.

"I'm not interested in doing that."</p><p>That's not to say that she doesn't see value in these kinds of scenes, as she understands that some films do benefit artistically from sharing that experience.

"If I was making a story that was about that journey of motherhood and body [acceptance]," she feels that might be different.</p><p>But, "I feel like, I'm sorry, but that would have to be with a female filmmaker. I don't have an absolute ban, but I kind of do with men," the actress explained.</p><p>Knightley has done fully nude sex scenes before, and with male directors. And despite her changing stance, she has absolutely no regrets about the choices she's previous made, telling <a href=#><strong>The Financial Times</strong></a> in March, "I never did anything that I didn't feel comfortable doing."</p><p>She went on to add, "I'm really happy with my body. It's done an amazing thing. But I also don't want to stand there in front of a whole film crew."</p><p><strong>Got a story or tip for us?
