Her daughter was taken in by the Edhi Foundation in Karachi after being abandoned as a newborn. The mother-of-two was&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>reduced to tears</a> as she opened up about the process of adopting her daughter.

The couple adopted their son Oscar in 2000 and daughter Ava in 2005 in the US after struggling to go through the process in Australia. “From the moment we started the adoption process, all the anxiety went away,” he told Herald Sun in 2011. “I don’t think of them as adopted – they’re our children."</p><p id=e1wz5q49bYyM1 data-wc=24>The issue is clearly close to their hearts, as Deborra founded Adopt Change in 2008 in an attempt to make adoption easier in Australia.</p><h2 dir=ltr>Sandra Bullock</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4c48c1edfc0e-sandra-bullock-kids-z.jpg><p id=epfpOnHGYLK0p data-wc=64><span><strong>Sandra Bullock</strong></span> is a doting mum-of-two after adopting her son Louis in 2010 before giving him a sister, Laila, a couple of years later.

"I can tell you absolutely, the exact right children came to me at the exact right time."</p><p id=eTCjbBC4mHAWq data-wc=93>The actress ensured her son was involved in the journey in 2012. "I didn't want Louis to think for a second that I wanted or needed more than him, because I had everything I needed," explained the star. "Towards the end of the process, I remember sitting Louis down – what I wanted to know was, ‘Is this the right match?’ He said, ‘I think so,’ and I asked why and he just said, ‘Because she’s my sister.’ And they went out and played and I was just sobbing."

Explaining Jackson's choice of outfit, she told Daily Mail “Yes, I thought she was a boy, too. Until she looked at me when she was three years old and said: ‘I am not a boy!’” Charlize continued: “So there you go!
