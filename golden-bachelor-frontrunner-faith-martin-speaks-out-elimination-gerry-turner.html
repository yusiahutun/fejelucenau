Faith was considered a frontrunner in the show as she received Gerry's First Impression Rose.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>PEOPLE </strong></a>following the episode, Faith, a high school teacher, opened up about her journey on the show and her relationship with Gerry. And despite her heartbreaking elimination, she only had positive things to say about Gerry, admitting that she would like to still have her ex in her life, even if it's platonically.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:920ee80f-11c6-46d9-9f1c-4b1a4670bcad data-container-ref=toofab:article:61302e8f-a897-4ac1-8867-c3b624649431 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/e6/5by4/2023/08/15/e66adb32d9804a928bc1e642be781ab2_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">ABC</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Golden Bachelor Gerry Turner Breaks Down While Discussing Late Wife in First Trailer</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"There's lingering feelings," she shared. "I truly love the guy. It felt so good to just be in his arms. I would love to have him in my life somehow, but I also think that's a big bite to ask for. I seriously could be friends with whoever he ends up with, and feel like I could love him appropriately in a non-romantic sense."</p><p>Looking back, Faith said her split from Gerry "was the best decision."</p><p>"I trust the wisdom in Gerry, that he's looking for specifics in his life that will work for him," she told PEOPLE. "I can respect that. But he really did touch a special place in my heart and showed me what I didn't have. I know one quality that I really, really am looking for -- that's the kind of quality that Gerry had."</p><p>Meanwhile, Faith admitted that she felt a breakup was possibly looming after her hometown date with Gerry.</p><p>“The last scene where I was standing there waiting and the car drove away, I remember having this feeling like, Oh, my God. What if this is the last time I see him?" she recalled. "Certainly I had in my brain the very real possibility that it may not work out. I remember feeling it right then. I cried when he drove off."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:1ccb451e-ec21-46c8-8f82-bcc92d5116f2 data-container-ref=toofab:article:61302e8f-a897-4ac1-8867-c3b624649431 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/74/5by4/2023/07/17/743aef1bacb84b3293246e995fb2c7f6_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">ABC</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Golden Bachelor Revealed: Meet 71-Year-Old Gerry Turner</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>As for why she believes Gerry pulled the plug on their romance, Faith said their different lifestyles and because they live far from one another may have played a part. (Faith lives in Washington, while Gerry resides in Indiana.)</p><p>"He never brought that up, but I had felt that that might've been," Faith told PEOPLE. "I remember that night thinking, 'Oh, should I have done that?' But, I wouldn't have been being honest had I not said that. He needed to know that because I'm just not the type of person that can see my kids a couple of times a year."</p><p>"The other part of it is, I love to camp and hike and backpack and be on my horses," added Faith, who said she prefers to spend time "outside more than in."</p><p>"I'd never played pickleball before," she said. "I mean, there's a million reasons that he might've gone, 'Ah. This isn't really a great fit,' even though we had a strong connection. As hard as it is for me to take, I feel like it was the best decision that he put me out when he did."</p><p>The Golden Bachelor airs Thursdays at 8 pm ET on ABC.</p><a id=gallery-link-189f3e04-258f-4a65-adf0-184532d0a31d class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:189f3e04-258f-4a65-adf0-184532d0a31d data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:61302e8f-a897-4ac1-8867-c3b624649431 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/1a/4by3/2023/08/30/1a695dbeb67c4a15aab15b6434452f8f_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGpmamhfnLytsMSnZJuZk52yrbvRZp2rp56pv7a6zZ6pZp6RnsGpecyaqa2hnmLAsbHApKpmp6Wpeqa4yKagp5mknryvecaeqauxXanCs7rEq2Y%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
