This started a new passion for Pohl — spoon collecting.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2023/04/Pohl-spoons.jpg><p>From antique shops and antique malls to flea markets, she has found silver spoons from coast to coast — Washington to Maine, California and Florida, Alaska and Hawaii. Pohl has expanded her travels to find unique spoons and has traveled to over 29 countries and visited many gift shops to buy souvenir spoons.&nbsp;</p><p>She is a member of two national spoon clubs and has attended numerous spoon conventions.&nbsp;Last year, Pohl won first place silver for her spoon display at the <a href=#>Northeastern Spoon Collectors Guild</a> Convention in Memphis, Tenn.</p><p>She has also won many blue ribbons at the Mississippi Valley Fair and the Iowa State Fair for her spoon displays.
