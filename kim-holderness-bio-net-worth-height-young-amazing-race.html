From Kim’s net worth to personal life and YouTube career–this wiki-article has it all.</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Kim Holderness Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>The net worth of The Holderness Family was estimated to be around $3 million as of January 2022. Most of their fortune comes from their YouTube earnings whereas merchandise also makes up a small part of their whole net worth.</p><p>Kim went to the University of Florida for education. She graduated in 1998 with a degree in telecommunications. Before working at Inside Edition from 2004 to 2008 in NYC, Kim had a decent reporting career in Florida.</p><p>From 2011 to 2012, Kim worked at the LStar where she learned about radio broadcasting, news writing, media production, creative writing, multimedia, among many other things. She was also a managing partner at Greenroom Communications from September 2008 to January 2017.</p><p>Kim and Penn started a family YouTube channel called The Holderness Family in September 2011. It was only in 2013 that the couple first found fame after one of their YouTube video titled “XMAS Jammies”– a parody of Will Smith’s Miami–went viral.</p><p>Since then, Kim and Penn have continuously posted videos–original music, song parodies, and skits–to YouTube. They release a new “XMAS Jammies” every holiday season and upload additional parodies in between. Some of their popular song parodies are Kin and Moose (a Halloween-themed Snoop Dogg parody), All About That Baste (a Meghan Trainor parody), It’s Vaccination Day ( a Frozen parody), to name a few.</p><p>They also have quite a few viral skills on their YouTube some of which are When Rona Won’t Leave, The New Normal, and Every Hallmark Movie Ever.</p><p>On May 1, 2018, Kim and Penn launched their podcast series called Holderness Family which is available to stream on every popular music streaming app. In 2021, Kim and Penn also authored Everybody Fights: So Why Not Get Better At It, a book on improving communication in a marriage.</p><h3><strong>Kim Holderness Job</strong></h3><p>Kim Holderness started her career as a reporter at WKMG TV.

The lovebirds first met somewhere in the years 2002 and 2003 in Orlando. Kim was a news reporter there in Orlando whereas Penn worked as a sports reporter for a different TV station in Orlando.</p><p>Pen had no one but the nature of his job to give thanks to for his relationship with Kim. He told, “When you work in local news you get off at 11:30, and there’s no one else to hang around with except for other people who work in local news. Everyone else is asleep!”</p><ul><li><h4><strong>How Long Have Penn And Kim Holderness Been Married?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>As of January 2022, Penn and Kim Holderness have been married for a little more than 16 years.

You are my favorite and it’s not even close.”</span></p><p>The couple met in Orlando, got married there, and then moved up to New York for better job opportunities.</p><p>From Penn’s interview with Carolina Parent, we got to know that Kim took a job for “Inside Edition” and Penn took a job at ESPN once they relocated to New York. Both of them lasted only three years in their job as they did not like their work as much as they thought they were going to.</p><p>The pair then had their first kid, Lola Holderness, in Tribeca, a neighborhood in New York. Lola was born on February 7, 2007. A massive fan of The Holderness Family would know that Lola also appears with her family on the YouTube channel, The Holderness Family. She made her YouTube debut with the video “Merry Christmas from the Holderness Family!! 2012” in December 2012.</p><p>What followed Lola’s birth was whole lotta stress and anxiety coming from the pressure to apply to a preschool in New York for the Holderness parents. “Let’s get the hell out of here!” is what Penn told to Kim at that moment. Therefore, the family moved to Raleigh, closer to Penn’s home.</p><p>Kim and Penn had two children by the end of the year 2009. Their second child, a boy, Penn Charles Holderness was born on December 23, 2009.
