The skiers-only mountain is renowned for its pristine slopes, après-ski champagne yurts and ultra high-end clientele.&nbsp;</p><p id=e_mOK1TpTrO data-wc=19><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Gwyneth Paltrow wins court case in her best outfit yet: How to recreate her blue velvet blazer moment</a></p><p id=eAAMZFwSUzi data-wc=23><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>As Anna Delvey rocks a seriously chic ensemble to attend her parole meeting, we predict what's next for everyone's favourite Netflix villain</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/009fa3e8a093-gettyimages-1249663711.jpg><p id=eh-KTrSdt7V data-wc=100>Sanderson claims that the actress-turned-lifestyle guru violently collided with him, in a hit and run incident whereupon she and her entourage continued their descent down the run, leaving him with serious injuries. Not since Amber Heard has the fashion world been so invested in a series of outfits emanating from a criminal case. From her glasses to her minimalist aesthetic, memes of the Goop founder’s outfits have been going viral and sartorial observers have noted every detail of her courtroom looks so far. (UPDATE: She has now <a class=hm-link href=#>won the case in her last, and best outfit of the entire proceeding</a>.)</p><p id=eG76FuCxvny data-wc=15><strong>We over analyse all the outfits that Gwyneth Paltrow has worn since going on trial:&nbsp;</strong></p><h2 dir=ltr>The Green Coat</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0410801e278d-gettyimages-1249036029.jpg><p id=eqKthQVm9Dkt data-wc=76>On March 21 Gwyneth Paltrow was seen leaving the courtroom in a long green coat which she teamed with classic aviators and brown boots. “For many people, the colour green has strong associations with nature and brings to mind lush grass, trees, and forests,” explains Very Well Mind, “Green is often described as a refreshing and tranquil colour.” Could Gwyneth be opting for some peace and calm amidst the proceedings by donning this forest inspired hue?&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>The Navy Ensemble</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/a8b222d143cb-gettyimages-1249297280.jpg><p id=eY5WLuq1yDv_ data-wc=92>One of her most beloved outfits for trial has been her dark long sleeved polo, which she teamed with a navy skirt and chunky black boots on March 24. According to Schiller & Hamilton Law Firm, “The best colour to wear to court is probably navy blue or dark gray. These colours suggest seriousness.” In a study performed by <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Jansen Voss</a> in 2005, research found that many lawyers prefer to wear blue suits on the first day of trial. This is because blue is thought to be a colour that “invokes trust.”&nbsp;</p><p id=eYw-PypH6hH9 data-wc=14><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Johnny Depp's lawyer issues stern advice to Gwyneth Paltrow amid ongoing ski trial</a></strong></p><p id=e3BR-UXdfeKG data-wc=11><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>10 minimalist outfits that you'll want to recreate this season</a></p><h2 dir=ltr>The Opticals&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/8e94a6b4f62c-gettyimages-1249006299.jpg><p id=etwwo3T2uISQ data-wc=55>On March 21 Gwyneth donned a pair of clear 70’s style optical glasses, which have caused something of a style frenzy. She has worn them in the past, namely to promote a Goop serum back in July 2022. This time she paired them with a white turtleneck jumper, it’s giving coastal grandma meets courthouse drama.</p><h2 dir=ltr>The Grey Blazer and Gold Necklaces</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/554241555a85-gettyimages-1249149050.jpg><p id=eO5UiGaSIZpM data-wc=78>One for the minimalists, Gwyneth served up some Scandi influencer vibes on March 23. Wearing a grey double breasted blazer and matching top, she teamed the look with two gold necklaces adorned with interesting pendants. The jewellery she sported had an almost Talismanic vibe, leading us to ponder… could these be her lucky courtroom amulets? Traditionally an amulet is a piece of jewellery thought to give protection against evil or danger. The verdict is out on this one.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>The Panto Glasses</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/c8a16b4b0a6f-gettyimages-1249295266.jpg><p id=eGbdmHQqgjKe data-wc=76>On March 24 she wore another pair of statement opticals, this time a brown thick-rimmed &nbsp;‘Panto’ pair. The term "panto" comes from the Greek word "pan", meaning "all," (interpret that as you will.) Panto glasses are a classic eyewear shape that have been around since the twentieth century, defined by a full base which creates a wide (pantoscopic) view. Are these specs helping her look at the bigger picture during her trial? You be the judge.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>The Pink Blouse</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/837ff7dd05ca-gettyimages-1249704731-1.jpg><p id=epDMHYAOyvuq data-wc=64>On March 28, Gwyneth wore a pastel pink blouse to court. Since pastel colours are less saturated than other hues, they are often associated with calm and peace. The look was soothing and easier on the eyes than some of her other courtroom wardrobe choices. Plus the Margaret Thatcher approved-pussy-bow? Maybe she’s trying to channel some of the former prime Minister’s stiff upper lip.&nbsp;</p><p id=eb1_UD8F21Up data-wc=21><strong></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbOue5Nxb29sYGTEpnnOr5yrmZ6Wubq%2FxGaesLGemsGpec%2Bao62qn6zAbq%2FOrqmtqp%2Bkum64zqiirGWYmr%2Bmv4ywn5qsXai1pnnHmqpmr5%2Bnu26%2Fzmadmqpf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
