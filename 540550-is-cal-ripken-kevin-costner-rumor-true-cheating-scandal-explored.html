Politicians have often used it to mock or dismiss allegations among them. Being disregarded means you will hardly ever know the truth behind such stories.</p><p class=align-left>So, whether true or not, the bizarre story of Kevin Costner and Cal Ripken requires some diving into, and you can decide for yourself.</p><h2 id=540550-the-cal-ripken-jr-and-kevin-costner39s-story class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>The Cal Ripken Jr and Kevin Costner's story</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8d1ecf6e50e655a3.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kenyan Newspapers Review, February 28: Woman Dies after Fight over EPL Match</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Before delving into the story, you must understand the dynamics and get a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">bit of context</a>. It will make more sense this way.</p><p class=align-left>Cal, the multitalented baseball player, is one of a kind. He currently <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">holds the record</a> for the most MLB games played in a row. To put it into perspective, Carl played 2,632 games without missing a start.</p><p class=align-left>Cal set the record for the most <a href=#>MLB games </a>played on September 6, 1995 and ended the streak on September 9, 1998. It is hard to beat this record as it is challenging to have such a commitment. However, Kevin Costner and Cal's long-standing rumour gives a different tale whereby this record would have been slightly lower.</p><h3 id=540550-camden-yards-power-outage class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Camden Yards power outage</h3><p class=align-left>On August 14, 1997, the lights wouldn’t turn on during a scheduled match between the Orioles and the Mariners. It was reported that the situation came about from a technical failure.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9295579692beddcc.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Morgan Heritage: Don't Haffi Dread and 6 Other Best Songs from World Renowned Reggae Group</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Then, Baltimore wanted to keep Cal's streak alive and would have done it at all costs. Therefore, there is a rumour that the failing lights weren't due to a technical problem but were intentional. The rumours state that it was a cover story. But for what? That is how the conspiracy theory involving Kevin and Cal came up.</p><h3 id=540550-cal-ripken39s-wife-cheating class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Cal Ripken's wife cheating</h3><p class=align-left>The story stated that Cal Ripken's wife and Kevin Costner were caught in bed. Having seen them in bed, Cal and Kevin exchanged blows in an altercation. The theory states that Kevin got injured in the altercation and couldn’t attend <a href=#>the game</a>.</p><p class=align-left>How did Kevin and Cal get linked, considering they have different professions? The two met at the premiere of <i>Dances with Wolves</i>. They reportedly got fond of each other and became good friends.</p><h2 id=540550-should-you-believe-the-cal-ripken-and-kevin-costner-story class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Should you believe the Cal Ripken and Kevin Costner story?</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/518eb93db2dcc71b.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who has the biggest forehead in the world? (With pictures)</span></p></a><p class=align-left>As with all conspiracy theories, there are numerous loopholes and questions that no one can answer. First of all, it is incredibly ridiculous for such to happen, but of course, you cannot ignore it.</p><p class=align-left>Another element that makes the story believable is that venues like Camden Yard have fail-safes in place, and you wouldn’t expect an outage to be a significant setback. That is why it seemed intentional and put some credibility on the conspiracy theory.</p><p class=align-left>The decision to cancel the game while Cal extended his winning streak seemed fishy to sceptics who believed there was an alternative explanation.</p><p class=align-left>Kevin Costner and Cal Ripken later publicly denied the rumour. Numerous witnesses saw Cal warming up on the field during the scheduled game. Therefore, there isn’t a reason to believe the rumours to be true. It is just a fun story to tell and likely nothing much.</p><p class=align-left>Kevin said the following <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">about the rumour</a>:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ce76188205f5473f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who killed Simon in One of Us is Lying?

If there is something alleged, I’d love to see someone come forward. No one will, because they don’t have the story to do it.
