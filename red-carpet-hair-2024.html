What happened to <a href=#>show-stopping red carpet hair</a>? Celebrities have started showing up to awards shows with flat and lifeless locks, and I’ve grown sick of seeing the same dull hairstyles over and over. We used to be a proper country—celebrities would go all out for the red carpet, and their hair wouldn’t be treated as an afterthought. Glamorous hair is so hard to find on the red carpet nowadays and it’s time we push for more drama on the red carpet.</p><p>In past years, we’ve seen some great red carpet hair moments. <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/lists/curly-haircut-trends/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Zendaya’s crimped curls</a> at the American Music Awards in 2014, Reese Witherspoon’s voluminous beach waves at the 2012 Golden Globes, Yara Shahidi’s gorgeous natural hair at the 2018 SAG Awards. Red carpets were once the beacon of hair trends—giving us all hair ideas to add to our inspiration boards, aspire to, and try at home.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"></figure><p>But in 2024, it’s become rare to see any memorable hair looks. This year’s Golden Globes was a sea of flat, boring hair. Margot Robbie, the star of Barbie, was in a full neon pink Barbiecore fit, and her flat loosely curled hair still missed the mark. At the 2024 Oscars, Barbie star Robbie’s hair was disappointing yet again. Riley Keough and Emma Stone also hit the Golden Globes red carpet with boring hair. Thankfully, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/fashion/celebrity-looks/1224971/jennifer-lopez-red-carpet/>Jennifer Lopez saved the day with voluminous curls</a> reminiscent of old Hollywood glamour.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-2074317692.jpg><p>While the majority of hair looks this year have been boring, there have been a few notable exceptions. Miley Cyrus served hair drama at the 2024 Grammys, her ’70s inspired hair was teased to perfection and didn’t skimp on the volume. While some fans on X expressed their distaste for the look, it was refreshing to see such a courageous hair decision, especially in the year of boring hair. Chic updos like <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/fashion/celebrity-looks/1361417/florence-pugh-oscars-look-2023/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Florence Pugh’s at this years’ Golden Globes</a> have proven that not all hairstyles have to be dramatic as Miley’s to get the job done.</p><p>As a lover of all things dramatic and glamorous, I’ve found this year has been extremely disappointing. The red carpet is supposed to be filled with noteworthy hair that epitomizes Hollywood glamour. I know that I have reason to be doubtful, but I hope to eat my words.</p><p>The few exciting hair moments we’ve gotten have given me hope. Maybe there will be better red carpet hair looks in our future. While some stars brought their best beauty looks, the 2024 Oscars were not short of disappointing hair.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=-1><h2>Emily Blunt at the 2024 Academy Awards</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-2074232863.jpg><p>Emily Blunt’s top bun reads more as a messy bun than an elegant updo. Maybe it’s just the messy stray hairs, but it’s not exactly red carpet ready.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0><h2>America Ferrara at the 2024 Academy Awards</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-2066791243.jpg><p>Barbie star America Ferrara arrived in full Barbiecore, but her hair fell short. Her loose waves aren’t as glammed as we would want to see, more defined curls would definitely bring this look up a notch.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.5><h2>Margot Robbie at the 2024 Academy Awards</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-2074308271_329b62.jpg><p>Sadly, Barbie star Margot Robbie seems to be a repeat offender. Although Robbie looks gorgeous no matter how she wears her hair, she showed up to the 2024 Oscars with messy, almost undone looking hair. Coupled with a black sequin dress, Robbie shocked her fans with a very unconventional Barbiecore look.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=-1.5><h2>Florence Pugh at the 2024 Academy Awards</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-2074282015_a4ca74.jpg><p>Florence Pugh’s hair at the 2024 Oscars fell short compared to her glitzy silver look. Pugh’s short hair was styled messily and definitely required a little more attention.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=-1><h2>Olivia Munn at the 2024 Academy Awards</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-2074352497.jpg><p>Olivia Munn’s hair seems to be lacking both volume and glamour. While it’s slightly wavy, it still seems undone and not exactly red carpet ready.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0><h2>Riley Keough's at the 2024 Golden Globes</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1908170896.jpg><p>While the Daisy Jones & The Six star is used to serving vintage looks, her hair falls short of that old school Hollywood glamour. With a little more volume and some defined curls, this hair look could’ve been taken to the next level.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0><h2>Margot Robbie at the 2024 Golden Globes</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1908167160.jpg><p>We love Barbie star Margot Robbie, but her 2024 Golden Globes hair just misses the mark. Like Riley Keough, her loose curls make it seem like she’s on day 2 of wearing the hairstyle. A Barbiecore look of this caliber requires a more glamorous hairstyle than what she went with.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0><h2>Emma Stone at the 2024 Golden Globes</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1908172933.jpg><p>Emma Stone’s shoulder length bob has the potential to be styled in so many different ways. Especially given the over the top hair looks in her film Poor Things, I expected a little more for her 2024 Golden Globes look. But, I have no doubt that she will redeem herself soon.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1><h2>Taylor Swift at the 2024 Grammys</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1986392526.jpg><p>Sorry to all the Swifties out there, but Taylor Swift’s hair at the 2024 Grammys didn’t deliver the level of drama I was wanting. While her outfit is definitely on the dramatic side of things, her hair doesn’t live up to the same standard. I like the braid, I just wish there was a little more volume at the roots and the bangs.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0><h2>Madison Beer at the 2024 Grammys</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1986527123.jpg><p>Madison Beer is known for her coquette, doll-esque looks. While her 2024 Grammys dress harps on her signature aesthetic, her hair doesn’t quite do the same. I would’ve loved to see a princess inspired half-up half-down hairstyle or even a chic updo to match the outfit.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1><h2>Dua Lipa at the 2024 Brit Awards</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-2054007458_52685b.jpg><p>Dua Lipa has started a huge cherry red hair trend this year, which makes her 2024 Brit Awards hair look even more disappointing. With such a bold color, I’d love to see a bold hairstyle to match. Not to mention, her smoky eye makeup is definitely giving us the drama that needs to be matched with her hair.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.5><h2>Maddie Ziegler at the 2024 SAG Awards</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-2028795535.jpg><p>Maddie Ziegler has been giving us amazing looks recently. While I love this pale yellow number from the 2024 SAG Awards, her hair isn’t doing it for me. I’ve definitely seen her pull off some interesting hairstyles, so hopefully her future looks will follow suit and give us more hair moments to obsess over.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.5><h2>Daisy Edgar-Jones at the 2024 BAFTA Awards</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-2022498634.jpg><p>Daisy Edgar-Jones is known for her iconic fringe and medium length hair. While she’s definitely served glamorous hair looks in the past, her 2024 BAFTA hairstyle just reads as messy to me. The curls seem to be haphazardly done and although that can be a good look for the everyday, this hair just doesn’t scream red carpet to me.</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfp7KlecKaqamdpGK1orXRZmlpamRk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
