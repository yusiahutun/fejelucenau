The photo, which was posted by “Lip Sync Battle” co-host and self-proclaimed “Clueless” superfan,&nbsp;<strong><a href=# id=auto-tag_chrissy-teigen data-tag=chrissy-teigen>Chrissy Teigen</a></strong>, featured Silverstone dressed head-to-toe like Cher with strappy white heels, shin-high socks, tousled blonde hair, and, of course, the character’s highly Instagrammable skirt suit.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/drdiamondmetacine.gif?w=960&h=540&crop=1"> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/celeb-red-hair.png><p>The ’90s icon posed alongside Teigen who was dressed in a robe and carrying her 1-year-old daughter, <strong>Luna</strong>.&nbsp;In typical Chrissy Teigen fashion, the 31-year-old model fangirled over the shot on Twitter, where she revealed that she’s only asked for two celebrity selfies in her life: one with<strong>&nbsp;Beyoncé </strong>(understandable) and the other with Silverstone dressed as Cher.</p><p>“How am I supposed to sleep? I think I’ve asked for 2 photos in my entire life. <span>@</span>AliciaSilv and beyonce,” Teigen tweeted.</p><p>Judging from Teigen’s very wide ear-to-ear grin, she appears to be a legitimate superfan. Luna, on the other hand look, ahem, a little clueless. Might be because the film was before her time. Either way, we Teigen cultures her daughter so they can pull of an epic “Clueless”-inspired family costume somewhere down the road.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2ispmK6sMLInqpobmltgXiDjpqjopuZlnq0tcuvnKurpKS7pnnCpayepJWowG671K2doqxdpbWwwM5o</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
