But my experience began before I even touched down at the beautiful AliKats’ Ferme À Jules flagship chalet in the French Alps.</p><p id=eblM08UxAMo data-wc=37>My first port of call was an introductory video chat with Caitlin, where we set out my intentions for the retreat, discussing what was important to me and areas of my life that I’d like to develop.&nbsp;</p><p id=eBcKMCim24 data-wc=14><strong>DISCOVER:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>How to be happy: 30 expert-approved tips to become your most optimistic self</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=exTe0NFkKiJ data-wc=32>Setting intentions was something I had never done at previous wellness retreats I’d embarked on, and encouraged me to fully commit and surrender myself to whatever Caitlin had in store for me...</p><h3>What happened on the retreat&nbsp;</h3><p id=eeZZPmmSJEx data-wc=26>I travelled alone to the retreat, but there were six other guests in the group – strangers who immediately made me feel comfortable and at ease.</p><p id=eklWdTIsBM data-wc=47>Our itinerary was made up of primarily group activities, consisting of exhilarating daily guided mountain or forest hikes, a yoga or qi gong session, wild swimming and life coaching tasks.

On our walks, we would often stop to forage wild strawberries (a skill we learnt after our foraging lesson with an AliKats chef).</p><p id=eBhsX3OF1d5H data-wc=47>Every evening was a gourmet delight. The plant-based produce we ate was keeping in harmony with the seasons, with everything locally sourced or homegrown – like wild garlic soup and vegetable pakoras.

One of our life coaching tasks was to hone in on our senses, one at a time, when we were embarking on one of our hikes: listening to the water trickling down a nearby river; noticing the varying shades of greens on passing leaves; smelling fresh air and damp soil.</p><p id=efaS0751Tj data-wc=14><strong>MORE HAPPINESS: <a class=hm-link href=#>I overhauled my entire life on a whim – here's what happened</a></strong></p><p id=erLS9YJi40EP data-wc=51>This act of mindfulness, I realised, taught me to quieten the chatter in my mind and to re-focus on one thing at a time. It’s an easy tool that you can try in your day-to-day life, and it's something I was keen to incorporate into mine on my return to normality.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/48c4d5b974ce-alikats-retreat-journalling.jpg><p id=emtQ9mfZC8cs data-wc=58>I also realised that something so simple as being amongst nature, even for a few minutes a day, really did make me feel happier. Now, I try and go for a daily walk after work at my local park, leaving my phone at home (something that Caitlin recommended we did during the retreat) to reflect on the day.&nbsp;</p><p id=eILgWOlT1pts data-wc=47>Putting myself outside of my comfort zone – which I did on a few occasions of this trip, such as during our wild swimming sessions – was an act that left me feeling proud and happier within myself, knowing that I was capable of pushing my boundaries.</p><p id=e_duiNXv22 data-wc=14><strong>DISCOVER:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>What are limiting beliefs and why are they stopping you from feeling happy?</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=e9ZGfiN6Sf data-wc=50>Finally, listening to, and learning from the other group members on the retreat was super insightful, and I<strong>&nbsp;came away with a changed perspective on what happiness and success means</strong>, more clarity on what things bring me joy and a renewed sense of energy to do more of those things.</p><p id=e0nhx9uzTyb3 data-wc=12></p><p id=e4u944rxW1 data-wc=13><span style=font-weight:bolder;font-family:Montserrat,sans-serif;font-size:15px;background-color:initial><strong>Subscribe to</strong></span><strong><span style=font-weight:bolder;font-family:Montserrat,sans-serif;font-size:15px;background-color:initial>&nbsp;</span><a class=hm-link href=#>Hello Happiness,</a><span style=font-weight:bolder;font-family:Montserrat,sans-serif;font-size:15px;background-color:initial>&nbsp;</span></strong><span style=font-weight:bolder;font-family:Montserrat,sans-serif;font-size:15px;background-color:initial><strong>for your ultimate guide on how to be happier.</strong></span></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
