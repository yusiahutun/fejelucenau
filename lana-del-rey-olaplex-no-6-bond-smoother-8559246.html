I’ve been a fervent fan of the singer for over a decade (ask me about my very rare LDR vinyl records). I was psyched to see her incredible album Did You Know That There's a Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd being nominated for five Grammy Awards — and then saddened when she was snubbed in all categories. But I’m trying to take a glass-half-full approach and simply be thankful for her first Grammys appearance since 2020. And let’s just say her look didn’t disappoint; she went for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>a soft, dark, and feminine coquette vibe</a> with, IMO, the best hairdo of the night.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She found a timeless way to channel the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>fleeting bow trend</a>, and it didn’t detract from how full, glossy, and thick her long strands looked. Per hair hairstylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>Jacob Schwartz</a>, the key to her Grammys look was a number of Olaplex products, including the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Margot Robbie- and Julianne Moore-used</a> <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">No. 6 Bond Smoother</a>.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to a press release from Olaplex, Schwartz says her hair is as magical as it seems. “Lana has fabulous dream hair and so much of it… Her hair just does what you tell it to do.” In this instance, he went for a “sultry and timeless” look. To achieve this he blow-dried her hair before applying the bond-building, frizz-defying, and texture-enhancing treatment to her strands.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Olaplex’s No. 6 Bond Smoother</a> is formulated with the proprietary and patented bond-builder that’s quickly made the brand a household name. According to Olaplex, the bond-building technology first and foremost penetrates past the superficial layers of hair that are reached with typical haircare products. Then, once it’s made its way deep into your strands, it heals hair, making it less prone to breakage and shedding, and minimizes frizziness.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Besides being used on the strands of celebrities, Olaplex No. 6 has racked up more than 41,000 five-star ratings on <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Amazon</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Dermstore</a> alone. <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">One shopper</a> said their hair used to be “so fine” that it broke before it could grow past their shoulders. But after using this Olaplex product, their hair is growing, and though “it’s still very fine, it’s healthier, more flexible, stronger, and smoother.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Head to <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Amazon</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Dermstore</a> to shop Olaplex’s Lana Del Rey-used No. 6 Bond Smoother.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57y5qlmmWUmrluvsSyZKikkaW5psSMp6Zmbl2XvK%2BwjKykqKeknbKzeZdubHJqZGs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
