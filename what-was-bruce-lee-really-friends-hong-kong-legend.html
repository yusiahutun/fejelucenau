‘Be water’: What was Bruce Lee’s philosophy, and why does it live on?
“The first time I met him was at a family dinner,” says Ng who met the star when he returned to Hong Kong in the early 1970s."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

To me, Bruce was an ordinary guy,” says Ng who trained under Vidal Sasson in London and stayed friends with the iconic hairstylist throughout his lifetime too. Her salon, Hair by Susan, was on Prince Edward Road at that time and Lee became a regular.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/07/21/7cda4abc-bd0c-11ea-b64b-070a892763db_972x_131841.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It was very soon after this first meeting that I started to cut Bruce’s hair. He would tell me to ‘remember continuity’, but I was never on the set and I was very busy with other clients,” she says. “One time Bruce said, ‘Make me look like a peasant’, so l cut his hair really short. To me that was a wonderful look. Then when he went to Rome to shoot his film Way of the Dragon, I created a longer style for him which was different for that time. It started a trend and people tried to copy it.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Bruce lived in Kowloon Tong close by my salon, and often while out jogging he would run into the salon and spar with the juniors working with me. This they loved, naturally.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Bruce used to drive a sports car. He spoke several times of when he went out people would confront him wanting to be the one who floored Bruce Lee. He ignored them but if they kept on provoking he would say, ‘OK, come on, let’s do it.’ They would then back down. One time, I was in my car near his home. I had picked my daughter up from the nearby kindergarten and he was backing out of his driveway in his sports car. I hooted my horn a lot for a joke. He turned his head slowly round in my direction with the look on his face like ‘are you looking for trouble’ but when he saw it was me, he gave me a wonderful smile.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/07/21/602bab66-bd0e-11ea-b64b-070a892763db_972x_131841.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Brandon, his son, was so very proud of his father. He would notice that the clients would be looking at pictures of his father in magazines and he would point at them and say, ‘That’s my father,’ then leave whistling as he went. My daughters Alex and Zoe would go to Brandon and Shannon’s birthday parties and we would take them out on our boat when Bruce was busy filming,” continues Ng.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/07/21/c523e07e-bd0e-11ea-b64b-070a892763db_972x_131841.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Before Bruce died, he told me he had ordered a Rolls-Royce.

I remember EYT was celebrating an anniversary and I asked Bruce if he would jump out of a large cake. He agreed. The audience were surprised, as Lee was so macho and usually sexy ladies would usually jump out of cakes,” continues Chua. “He was a lot of fun. He loved surprising people. We always had a chat and I remember fondly how he would always try to scare me for fun. Like give me a flying kick.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“He was friendly and humble, so that’s why we became friends. Although we were good friends, we never socialised. We had great respect for each other. We were too busy with what we were doing. We would go for lunch or meet up together. When he left Hong Kong I would see him off at the airport or when he came back I would pick him up,” continues Chua, who still creates TV shows but now spends a lot of time creating restaurant concepts throughout Southeast Asia.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">How much would you pay for Bruce Lee’s punchbag?</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“When he passed away I could not believe it. I immediately put together a documentary about his life for TVB which we did within two days.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/07/21/1c58ecca-bd0c-11ea-b64b-070a892763db_972x_131841.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ng recalls, “Bruce was a talkative chap and one time he discussed a film he was going to make, he had written the story already and he told me the details of it. It was about a man who was looking for the meaning of life. He searched everywhere. The film ends with him finding a book that upon opening it was a mirror. The answer to what he was searching for was himself. Bruce died soon after telling me this. Years later, I watched a similar film and when it came to the end where a man opened a book to reveal a mirror, I realised it was Bruce’s film.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Want more stories like this?
