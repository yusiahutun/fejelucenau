During the steamy photoshoot for People Magazine, the actress confirmed that she and Bobby are exclusively dating each other. On 28 April 2022, they were spotted passionately kissing each other in Central Park only to come up for air for him to hug her mother, Kathy, so the relationship must be serious already, as PageSix noted.</p><p>Bobby and Katie were also walking hand in hand or with their arms wrapped around each other. People reported that they eventually left the park to visit the Guggenheim Museum.</p><p>PageSix reached out to the actress’s representative for comment but they are yet to respond.</p><p>The budding relationship with the musician is her first public relationship with Katie since her break-up with Emilio Vitolo Jr. in May 2021. Katie and Emilio dated for nearly eight months of dating.</p><p>Katie was also rumored to be dating actor <a href=#>Luke Kirby</a>. Luke and Katie first met on the set of Paul Dalio’s film Mania Days. In May 2013, the pair were first spotted together in New York City walking together. While the rumors of Luke and Katie dating were still strong, Katie told to Allure Magazine in March 2013 that there was no man in her life at the time. However, she indicated the possibility of expanding her family.</p><p>Katie was still dealing with the fallout from her divorce from Top Gun actor Tom Cruise at the time. Suri Cruise’s mother has been associated with or engaged with a number of other people throughout her life. She was engaged to actor Chris Klein, who was best known for his parts in the American Pie films, about 2004. After breaking off her engagement with Chris, she began seeing Tom Cruise in 2005, announced their engagement in June 2005, welcomed their daughter in April 2006, and married later that year in Italy. Unfortunately, the actress from Batman Begins filed for divorce in 2012.</p><p>In August 2012, Katie finalized her divorce from Tom. A year later, she fueled dating rumors with actor Jamie Foxx. Despite the fact that the couple never commented on their dating rumors and kept their relationship mostly hidden from the public eye, sources claim that they split up in 2019. Until May 2021, the Jack and Jill actress dated Emilio Vitolo Jr.</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Bobby Wooten III Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>Bobby Wooten III has built an accumulated net worth of $750K.</p><p>First and foremost, Bobby is a musician, a bassist to be more precise.

His friends requested him to play bass, and that is how he began playing the instrument.</p><p>Bobby stated he rapidly learned numerous Motown songs, as well as other favorites like Stevie Wonder and the Red Hot Chili Peppers, once he got started.

He explained, “In American Utopia, [David] very much wants everyone to have their own voice. That’s why there are different characters and each person’s spirit resonates differently. It’s a great thing to be performing on Broadway as yourself”.</p><p>He added further, “What I’ve taken away from working with him is he likes things to be simple: to put forward an idea and not distract from it, which is awesome”.</p><p>Moreover, Bobby has also received credit as the bass player on the cast album for the stage adaptation of Moulin Rouge! The Musical.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Bobby’s Facebook, he studied Jazz at Indiana University (Bloomington) and graduated in the class of 2011.</p><p>Per his LinkedIn which is likely Bobby’s, he is a self-employed professional musician.</p><h3><strong>Bobby Wooten III Age</strong></h3><p>Reportedly born in 1989, Bobby Wooten III is 33 years old as of April 2022.</p><h3><strong>Bobby Wooten III Family</strong></h3><p>Bobby Wooten III was born to his father Bobby Wooten II and mother Ismadi Hernandez Wooten.
