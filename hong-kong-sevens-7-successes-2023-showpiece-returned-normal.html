Women broadened appeal</strong></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Without doubt the entire complexion of the Sevens changed with the inclusion for a first time in Hong Kong of a full leg of the World Rugby Women’s Sevens Series.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">No one did more to impress on its behalf than New Zealand’s women, who were comfortably the most polished performers in either the women’s or men’s competitions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/04/05/cb4b5b65-746c-4676-ae47-1463059124a5_3808d280.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Their final with Australia finally pitted them against a side close to their level, and they showed they were mortal by spilling a couple of try chances, but they were always in charge and always front and centre in women’s rugby’s latest advance.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">3. Home teams delivered</strong></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">With the stadium packed with Hongkongers, it made for perfect synergy. The women, playing above their normal level, surely inspired all who saw them, and their handful of tries were highlights of the Friday and Saturday.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And the men did that too, while adding what was, for them, a vital breakthrough.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/04/05/0ac1bd14-4aa9-40de-b74e-2c6a524eaba3_1126e908.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">So often hailed for being plucky, they wanted results, and eventually took the scalps of two World Series teams on their way to winning the Shield, altering how they will see themselves. Their exertions were rewarded with the slowest, most hardworking lap of honour imaginable.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">4. No Covid regs changed everything</strong></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There were still lingering reservations last November.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Sevens had returned from its pandemic-enforced hiatus yet required a measure of wishful thinking. Whatever the fairly workable reality of being allowed to remove a face mask while eating or drinking, the masks themselves remained miserable symbols of the city and muzzled to a small degree the spirit of the Sevens.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/04/05/f559cc4c-6f9f-4538-956a-3abf241ab57d_2cbc6838.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">To move forward from that state of affairs, by casting them aside, was vital.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">5. Good PR for rugby</strong></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Before Hong Kong, all we had heard from rugby in recent times had been rumblings about a boring, overly technical sport whose low ball-in-play time was alienating audiences – not to mention chatter about concussions and increasingly farcical punishments for dangerous tackling.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The athleticism and core skills seen at the Sevens were a real antidote to all that.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/04/05/0e44a5e5-23f2-4a4d-b547-399ff376fcbc_387aacd4.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">6. New Zealand were back</strong></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Two hakas – one apiece by the New Zealand women’s and men’s teams – rounded off the Sevens and tells you where the top-level silverware headed. Since the previous Hong Kong Sevens last November, when they flopped by missing out on the Cup quarterfinals for the first time ever in the city, the Kiwi men had transformed their fortunes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">They arrived back in town five months later sitting on top of the World Series standings, and swiftly set about showing they deserved to be. Nine years after they last had, it was high time the men in black reigned in Hong Kong.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/04/05/2b29aaf9-f10e-4978-8358-7412544e5c20_9a858093.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">7. The fans smashed it</strong></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hong Kong Rugby Union chairman Chris Brooke said at the tournament launch a month ago that the spectators were “in many ways the lifeblood of the Sevens”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">We saw that again this year. Showing up for three long days (granted, everyone built in some downtime), getting behind all of the teams, eating and drinking themselves to a standstill, roaring themselves hoarse and dressing up a storm, they again made the Hong Kong showpiece a Sevens like no other.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1mq62Xl8ZwtMpmqp6ulaPAcK3RraCcpJVkgHN9lWlubmeYpLuoecqopaBlo5rDprrSZm5mq6WYsKa%2F0p6qZmpgZ4Buv8eorqmhlZiybr7ErayrppWZeq%2B70aaYpQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
