  But why exactly would you need extra keys? After all, many keyboards drop less-used keys like the NumPad, function keys, and even the number row.
So, here's our rundown on the macro pad and its potential uses.

These pads are designed to work with your main keyboard, which you can then use to assign commands, keyboard shortcuts, and macros (hence the term macro pad).</p><p>A macro, on the other hand, is a recorded sequence of keyboard and mouse actions. This recording allows you to automate long, tedious tasks on your computer, thus saving you time and effort. So, after you assign a macro to a specific key on a macro pad, it will initiate once you press the set button.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-uses-macro-pads>Who Uses Macro Pads?</h2><p>While anyone can use a macro pad, who would actually need it? After all, the mouse and graphical user interface have allowed practically anyone to use computers and be adept at them. However, while graphical menus make it easy to use any app, it's still not as fast as keyboard shortcuts.</p><p>For example, it might take you three seconds to right-click on some text and select copy, but it will probably take you just one second to press <strong>CTRL + C</strong>. However, if you set a macro key just for copying, you no longer have to press two keys to copy anything. Instead, just tap the copy key, and you're good to go.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another example is gaming: if you're playing an <a href=#>RPG</a> or <a href=#>RTS</a> game, some commands require you to click multiple on-screen buttons or press a combination of keys. But, say you assign a macro key for a complicated command that requires numerous clicks or keypresses; then you save time and gain the upper hand.</p><p>While you might think that saving half a second isn't worth the cost of buying and setting up a macro pad, if you're doing this action hundreds or even thousands of times in a day, you're saving a lot of time.</p><h2 id=how-to-use-a-macro-pad>How to Use a Macro Pad</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Macro-Keys-on-Gaming-Keyboard-cropped.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A macro pad is pretty simple to use and set up. In fact, you can <a href=#>build a budget macro pad</a> yourself or buy some of the <a href=#>best gaming keyboards with built-in macro keys</a>. If you purchase a pre-built macro pad or a keyboard with a built-in macro pad, these usually come with customized software, allowing you to easily assign commands, key combinations, and basic and advanced macros.</p><p>However, if you're saving money and don't want to build a DIY macro pad, you can use any old keyboard you have lying around. However, you must buy a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hasu USB to USB Controller Converter</a>, which turns any keyboard into a fully programmable macro pad.</p><p>Once you've programmed all the keys on the macro pad, all you need is to press whatever key you want. Doing that will activate the command or macro you've recorded for that specific key.</p><h2 id=macro-pads-save-you-time>Macro Pads Save You Time</h2><p>While some may think that macro pads are a bother to program and not worth the time, effort, and cost to set up, it does save you time. After all, if you repeatedly run complicated but repetitive and tedious commands that require multiple clicks or keypresses, a macro pad can help you run it for you automatically.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is especially true for professionals working on massive projects with complicated apps. And once you learn how to set up macros, the skies are the limit. You can automate everything—from launching your work apps and placing them in the proper area on your monitor to exporting the video project you're working on with your chosen settings.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0ecBmpJqboqR6sa3DaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
