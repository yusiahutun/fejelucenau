Pro wrestling has featured several enormous men in its rings. Some of these wrestlers are so large to seem real. There have been professional wrestlers who are over 7 ft. tall and beyond 400 lbs. However, being tall and skilled has offered most wrestlers massive advantages over their opponents.</p><h2>Tallest WWE wrestlers</h2><p class=align-left>WWE has featured several tall wrestlers, but according to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Sportster</a>, these are the tallest in history.</p><h3>1. Giant Gonzalez - 8’0”</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0bbb5459832e441c.jpg><p class=align-left>Giant Gonzalez is the only 8 ft. wrestler ever featured for WWE. The former basketball player had colorful years in WWE in the 90s. Clad in a furry, full-body jumpsuit, Giant Gonzalez was the tallest wrestler in the <a href=#>world</a> and one of the physically imposing players.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0357e2b8d197f181.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 best Aquarius anime characters that you'll love</span></p></a><p class=align-left>One of his signature shows was against Undertaker in early WrestleMania matches - it was a show-stopper. Unfortunately, Giant Gonzalez's career didn't reach greater heights like some other giants.</p><h3>2. Andre the Giant - 7’4”</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0357e2b8d197f181.jpg><p class=align-left>Andre Rene Roussinoff, popular as Andre the Giant, was 7 ft. 4 inches tall and the second largest wrestler. Andre the Giant had a successful career and some significant wins, the most famous being against Hulk Hogan during the 80s.</p><p class=align-left>However, most people that watched him mostly spoke of his gregarious personality. Andre had a great attitude toward his friends and was highly competitive.</p><p class=align-left>He was regarded as the 8th wonder of the world, which made him seem like the tallest and largest man to ever walk on Earth. But in terms of WWE stars, he only ranked as second.</p><h3>3. Omos - 7’3”</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/38fcc6132dfd22e8.jpg><p class=align-left>Tolulope Omogbehin, a 28-year-old Nigerian athlete, is the youngest player on this list. Omos stands at 7 ft. 3 inches tall and weighs 183 kg. His first appearance in WWE was in June 2020, Monday Night Raw. He was a member of Akira Tozawa's Ninja group.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9f1159dad8fd4c1b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15 famous rappers with dreads you should follow on Instagram</span></p></a><h3>4.

The former Brazilian <a href=#>basketball player</a> was 7 ft. 2 inches tall. He was nicknamed Giant Silva in WWE and was an infamous Oddities team member.</p><p class=align-left>However, he competed on the losing end of handicap matches and the tag team. Unfortunately, Giant Silva didn't stay in WWE for long and left little mark than other prominent men of his time.</p><h3>5. The Great Khali - 7’1”</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9f1159dad8fd4c1b.jpg><p class=align-left>Dalip Singh Rana, popular as The Great Khali, can't miss the list of the tallest WWE wrestlers. The Indian star is 7ft. 1 inch tall, and his huge frame won him the World Heavyweight Championship in 2007.</p><h3>6. Jackson Andrews - 7’1”</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/56db3646aaab0934.jpg><p class=align-left>Jackson Andrews featured for FCW from 2009 to 2011, and his colossal frame was his primary asset. He was particularly rigid and thus didn't move quite swiftly while in the ring. He was released from WWE in 2010. Unfortunately, Jackson is more famous for domestic violence involving Rosa Mendes (WWE Diva) than anything he did in the ring.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f613a269182cde8e.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 NBA players with dreads, ranked by their popularity in 2024</span></p></a><h3>7.

Big Cass joined WWE through the NXT system and later debuted on the main roster in 2016 alongside Amore. He quickly became a <a id=https://www.tuko.co.ke/389085-wwe-superstars-salary-match-who-highest-paid-wrestler.html href=#>star in WWE</a> because of his big frame. Cass started competing for the universal title five months after entering the main roster.</p><h3>8. Big Show - 7’</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/59a9c9c51fc2125d.jpg><p class=align-left>Paul Donald Wight, or the big show, is one of the tallest players in WWE. Many know him as the world's most prominent athlete, but the 7 ft. WWE wrestler ranks sixth among the all-time wrestlers in history. The massive height and overall size have made Big Show so famous.</p><h3>9. Kane - 7’</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f613a269182cde8e.jpeg><p class=align-left>Glenn Thomas Jacobs, or Kane, is a professional wrestler and American politician.

Kane's career has been successful, and he has won several major WWE medals.</p><h3>10. Uncle Elmer - 7’</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e251bda8a40ce41d.jpg><p class=align-left>He was more of a gimmick than a pro wrestler, and his height ideally added to his character. Uncle Elmer stood at 7 ft. and weighed 475 pounds, but sadly he only wrestled for 2 years before retiring due to a weakening physical condition.</p><p class=align-left>He is among the forgotten tallest WWE wrestlers because he had no significant accomplishments in <a href=#>the game</a>.</p><h3>11. Brian Norton - 7”</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/705a805f6811a9ec.jpg><p class=align-left>Brian Norton was nicknamed "The Northern Irish Nightmare." However, many WWE fans didn't get the chance to see him. He wrestled from his hometown as Tron. If things could've worked out for him in WWE, Norton could've been known more than his fellow Irishman Sheamus.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/293538e630429350.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 best Baltimore rappers you should be listening to in 2023</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The Northern Irish Nightmare's career start wasn't great, so he signed a developmental deal with WWE at age 26. But the WWE officials saw little potential from the 7 ft. giant. He was released by WWE in 2011.</p><h3>12. Robert Maillet - 6’ 11”</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8109b3dd0430ef57.jpg><p class=align-left>Robert Maillet is a famous Canadian actor and a retired pro wrestler.

He joined WWE in 1990, but in 1996 he went to WCW. Nash didn't shy away from using his massive body as a pro wrestler. This offered him an advantage against his opponents but also made him get some serious injuries throughout his career.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b5920d2e2201b4ac.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Big Brother Titans housemates 2023: names, profiles, and pictures</span></p></a><h3>14.
