During their 10 days in “The Pods”, the couples decide if they wanted to get engaged—still sight unseen—or end their relationships for a better connection with someone else. After the proposal, the couples meet face-to-face for the first time and go on a honeymoon, where they learn more about each other and meet the other couples. After the trip, the couples, who all live in the same city, return to the real world and move into an apartment together as they meet each other’s families and friends and prepare for their weddings. At the altar on their wedding days, the couples must decide whether to marry or breakup as they answer the age-old question of if love can be truly blind.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>Since <a href=# rel=noopener>Love Is Blind</a> premiered on Netlix in 2020, the show has become one of service’s highest-rated series, with more than 30 million views in its first two months. “Across the world, everybody feels the same way: Everyone wants to be loved for who they are on the inside. It doesn’t matter where you live, what you look like, how old you are, what your background is, which class you know, or social structure you feel like you’re a part of, everyone wants to be loved for who they are,” creator Chris Coelen told Variety in 2020. “In today’s society we’ve got all these ways to find love through dating apps and technology. Those things sort of counterintuitively have made people feel disposable. They’ve made people feel like it’s all surface level. It does the opposite thing it was supposed to do. So we thought, what if we took everybody’s devices away, how could we get them to focus on connecting with other people?”</p><p>Coelen also told <a href=# rel=noopener>Variety</a> about how&nbsp;the connections on <a href=# rel=noopener>Love Is Blind</a> were based on choice, which is why the relationships were that much stronger. “It was incredibly scary because nobody had to do anything, versus a show like we do Married at First Sight, you sign up and you know, you’re getting married to a stranger. Here, nobody had to do anything. It was if you find someone, if you choose. Which is so scary. They don’t have to go through with the wedding ceremony,” he said. “But assuming they found someone, could that love overcome any judgment in the real world? That’s an incredibly fascinating question. And that’s what we set out to try to examine.”</p><p>But back to Raven and SK. So…are <a href=# rel=noopener>Raven and SK still together from Love Is Blind season 3</a>? Read on for what we know about if Raven and SK are still together after Love Is Blind season 3 and where they are now since filming ended.</p><h2>Are Raven and SK still together from Love Is Blind season 3?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Raven-SK-Love-Is-Blind-Season-3.png><p>Are Raven and SK still together after Love Is Blind season 3? The answer is no. In the final episode of the Love Is Blind: After the Altar special in February 2023, Raven revealed that she and SK broke up after he cheated on her. “That really sucks. Since then, a lot has changed. My world is completely different. Because SK cheated on me, and now our relationship is over. It’s so crazy to watch it back and remember my feelings then,” Raven said in a clip recorded on her phone months after she and SK got re-engaged on Love Is Blind: After the Altar.</p><p>She continued, “I was so happy. I really was so invested in the person that everyone saw and everyone loved. That’s the person that I saw and I loved everyday too. So to see everything that has happened since then is so hard. Because that was not the person I thought I was with. I cannot imagine opening up to someone like I opened up to SK. That’s always been my personal challenge and I know it’s a blessing in disguise and I can take that into another relationship. I know in my heart I still believe in love, of course. This is someone I trusted with anything. I still believe in love, and I’m so happy for my friends who have found that. They are my biggest inspiration, and I know it’s coming for me.”</p><p>So who did SK cheat on Raven with after Love Is Blind season 3? In a TikTok video in November 2022, a woman by the TikTok handle <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">@emmwho9</a> claimed that she went on a date with a Love Is Blind season 3 cast member who was still with his fiance he met on the show. “Put a finger down if you went on a date in April with a guy from Hinge and then you see that he’s actually on the show Love Is Blind, and that he met you after the show was filmed, but is still with the same girl right now,” she said before putting her finger down.</p><p>In another TikTok <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">video</a>, the user confirmed the cast member was SK. The video included a clip of SK, as well as screenshots of texts from him. “What’s up Em…it’s SK from Hinge,” SK wrote, to which the user responded, “Hello. Hi.” In another text, SK wrote, “I’m honestly ready to plan our ramen date coz I’d date to have to go without you lol. When are u free this week,” to which the user responded, “Emmm can I let you know. I’m having a bad week I’m extremely behind.” In another text, SK complimented the user on a bikini photo she went. “WOOW give me a minute…my phone is too hot to handle at the moment lol. Bathing suit looks fire on you.” The user also included screenshots of Instagram DMs between her and SK, as well as DMs she sent to Raven on Instagram after she learned that she and SK were still together when they went on a date. “I’m guessing you have now seen the video since SK unfollowed me, as you can see the last text he sent me was 4 months ago. I’m so sorry, but if you were together then I am sending you receipts of everything incase you want them,” the user wrote in the DM. She captioned the video, “I didn’t want to do this, but hate to see cheating men get away with it.”</p><p>In a TikTok live at the time, Raven responded to cheating accusations and confirmed she and SK were still together “Rumors are rumors, and we’re fine,” she said. “That’s my man, and I’m sticking beside him.”</p><p>Soon after, another woman by the TikTok handle <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">@hannahbethstyle</a> posted a video claiming she and SK dated on and off from 2019 to 2022. “It all started in 2019… we became good friends & started dating (bf/gf, attended weddings, birthday celebrations, etc.) Broke up mutually & remained friends,” Hannah wrote in the video, which also included time-stamped texts and photos of her and SK from 2019 to 2022. “We left Ibiza & flew back to Madrid. I asked to see his phone to send pics to myself but ended up seeing messages from a contact name “fiance.” I waited to front him until dinner bc I was trying to wrap my head around what I saw,” Hannah wrote later in the video. She continued, “This is the dinner where I asked about finding a ‘fiance’ in his phone & he told me it was for the LIB show but it was just for $ & they were friends only…I didn’t 100% believe him but he never gave me a reason to not trust him so I just trusted his word & it made sense (at the time).”</p><p>She continued, “I brought my reservations one more time before we flew home and said I should meet raven if this is all fake, and he agreed. I found her on IG, liked her pics & didn’t think anything of it. Until..As we were waiting outside for an Uber, I glance over & see him receive an IG notification from her and the message said, ‘Ummm who this?’ With my profile attached. He says to me: ‘I told you I was going to handle it.’ So I was like that’s weird but ok..” Hannah went on to include texts and photos of her and SK, going on vacation together and planning trips up until September 2022, two months before the Love Is Blind season 3 reunion premiered where SK and Raven confirmed they were back together.</p><p>In a joint statement on their Instagrams in November 2022, Raven and SK confirmed they had broken up after the cheating rumors. “We are saddened to announce that we have decided to go our separate ways,” the statement read “Due to on-going legal proceedings surrounding these allegations, we can not provide additional details and ask that you please respect our privacy during this hard time.” The statement concluded, “Thank you for following our love story and believing in us. This journey has forever shaped our lives and we are so grateful for everyone who has been a part of it. Your love and support means everything.”</p><h2>What happened to Raven and SK on Love Is Blind season 3?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Raven-SK-Love-Is-Blind-Season-3.png><p><span>What happened to Raven and SK on Love Is Blind season 3? Raven and SK broke up in episode 10 of </span>Love Is Blind<span> season 3 after SK told Raven “I do not” at the altar of their wedding. “Today Raven, we both know how we feel about each other. I love you. However, we have a very unique and complex set of circumstances. I feel like today is not the best time for us to do this,” SK told Raven after he broke up with her.</span></p><p>A year and a half after their wedding, Raven and SK revealed during the Love Is Blind season 3 reunion that they were back and dating. “Have you guys talked since then, been out since then, hooked up since then?” host Vanessa Lachey asked SK and Raven, to which Raven responded, “Yes.” Vanessa then asked, “So are y’all dating now,” to which Raven responded, “Yeah.” Raven and SK then got up and kissed in the middle of the room.</p><p>During the reunion, Raven and SK also explained how their relationship works while SK lives in California and Raven still lives in Dallas. “Our communication, I think I can speak for the both of us, we’ve never been on this level in any other relationship,” Raven said. “Every time, we reach a new level. Nothing is perfect, but we’ve grown so much from this experiment, first of all, from what we went through, from being apart, it makes it so much better when we’re together. Of course, I would prefer to be with him every day. But we’ve grown so much from it, and it’s really beautiful to do that.”</p><p>Raven and SK explained how they got back together in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Extra</a> after the reunion aired. “[I] just reached out and apologized. It was very heartbreaking, watching her cry,” SK said. “We’re taking things [one day] at a time, you know? Just working our way through things, and I’m excited about the future.” When asked if Raven plans to move to California to be closer to SK, she responded, “We will find out.” She continued, “SK and I both had so much growth, like, our journey was so beautiful and it was so great to be able to rewatch it. I smiled so many times.”</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Bustle</a> before the reunion aired, SK hinted that he and Raven were back together and were “taking” their relationship “one day at a time.” “I’ve been in touch with her,” he said. “We’re just kind of taking it one day at a time right now.” Raven also told Bustle that she and SK were “in a great place” since their breakup. “We have so much more of our story to tell, and more of our story to come, so we’re excited about sharing that with you guys,” she said.</p><p>SK revealed to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Us Weekly</a> in November 2022 that he reached out to Raven after Love Is Blind season 3 finished filming and the two are on “good terms.”&nbsp;“After the show, I reached out to her and we talked things over and we are on good terms. We’re just taking things one day at a time right now. I’m very consumed with school, so it’s been very, very hard to even try to do anything serious. … We’re just taking things one day at a time,” he said.</p><p>Raven also confirmed to Us Weekly that she and SK were still “working” on their relationship after he said “I do not” at their wedding. “We’ve been working on it,” she said. “And he’s just such a beautiful person, so we’ve been giving each other patience. It’s been great.” She also told the magazine that, though she was “shocked” by SK’s answer at the altar, the moment also gave them the opportunity to “grow together and be patient” in their relationship. “In some ways, I was definitely shocked. Him and I didn’t talk about, like, a definitive answer before we got up on the altar, but I knew in my heart and I knew in his that, like, we had this incredible journey and that was so special to us,” she said. “And we’ve worked through so many other problems that even if it’s not our time today, like, pretty soon we can try to work on it and get better and just keep growing — that’s probably the best thing that we did throughout this entire thing is just grow together and be patient.”</p><p>During episode 10 of Love Is Blind season 3, SK explained to producers in an interview after his wedding that he broke up with Raven because of the cultural differences between her and his Nigerian family, as well as her unwillingness to move from Texas to California with him. “It is no question in my mind. I love Raven. I know she’s probably mad and angry, but I just would feel really bad and really guilty to continue on in a marriage with her when I know there are so many other unanswered questions,” he said. “It’s not just about me having to leave after our marriage. It’s about her not being flexible to maybe move to California with me. It’s also about certain things I know for a fact that she’s very strong about. I still have a little bit of an issue with the family situation. I have thought about the risk of losing her forever because of my decision today, but as sad as it sounds, I think I would rather lose her than be in a marriage with her where I will feel a lot of shortcomings from her everyday.”</p><p>In her own interview with producers after the wedding, Raven confirmed she planned on telling SK “I do” before he broke up with her. “I was planning on saying ‘yes’ today,” she said. She also told producers she was confused over why SK broke up with her.&nbsp;“I am not the perfect Nigerian bride and we’ve established that so many times. I don’t know if I can ever be that way just because that’s not who I am,” she said.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> after her breakup with SK, Raven revealed that she was “shocked” by SK’s decision to not say “I do.” “I was clearly really shocked,” she aid. “I feel like the whole time, I was definitely not portrayed as an emotional person. So it was probably shocking for everyone to see me be such a crybaby.” She continued, “But it was a really emotional day. I definitely was unprepared. We had gone through this whole experience. I was definitely on cloud nine after our build-up of having a great relationship, so I was a little shocked.”</p><p>SK also confirmed to Bustle that he didn’t say “I do” to Raven because of “fundamental differences” between them, including “the role of family” and “her not being flexible about moving to California.” “At the very moment, when I got to the altar, it was just a flood of decisions for me to make at the same time,” SK said. SK also told People that he would have felt “guilty” telling Raven “I do” “when I know there are so many unanswered questions” “I think Raven and I’s story, the way it was portrayed on the show, I kind of feel bad watching it, especially from the perspective of the audience, because a lot of our love story wasn’t completely told in the way it was portrayed,” he said. “The narrative focused a lot more on some other subjects and some other incidents in the show.” He continued, “I feel like the audience missed out on that love story, on how it even came to be. If I were watching it myself, not being in the experience, I would have a lot of blanks.”</p><p>SK also confirmed <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Us Weekly</a> at the time that the “unresolved differences” between him and Raven was the ultimate reason he said “I do not” at their wedding.&nbsp;“It was like merging two different people from two different continents trying to make this work,” he said. “And I just felt like we still had a lot of unresolved differences that adding a marriage on top of that still would not help us resolve. Also, I would’ve had to move, like, four days after we got married and because of where we are at in our relationship, I didn’t think our relationship was ready for that.”</p><p>During his interview with Extra, SK also explained that, while he wasn’t ready to tell Raven “I do” at their wedding because of “fundamental differences” between them at the time, he still saw a future with her. “I think the biggest thing that pushed me over the line or didn’t push me over the line was, you know, lots of the fundamental differences we had on major things that were important to me are important in our relationship. I just felt like in the moment adding a marriage on top of that would not make those problems go away, or at least make those differences get resolved. We had different opinions on the role family plays in a relationship or in a marriage,” he said. “The fact of her not being open or flexible to moving to California was also big, amongst other things.” He continued, “I just didn’t feel like at the moment, and even if I had said yes and we got married, I would have had to move in the next 23 or 24 days right after that. That would have been very difficult. I didn’t think our relationship was in the point to be able to withstand that.”</p><p>According to SK’s <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Linkedin</a>, he’s moved to San Francisco, California, while Raven lists on her <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Facebook</a>, Pilates by Raven, that she still lives in Dallas, Texas, where Love Is Blind season 3 filmed. SK’s <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Twitter</a> also lists his location as San Francisco. Raven and SK also don’t follow each other on Instagram. SK moved to San Francisco around January 2022 when he took a job as a co-chair of UC Launch in Berkeley, California. “UC LAUNCH is University of California’s leading accelerator program that guides startups from prototype to pitch. Since 1999, our program has helped transform early-stage startups into fundable companies. Over the past five years, our alumni have raised over $125 million, topped the Forbes 30 under 30, and 9 startups have gone on to Y Combinator,” his job description reads. SK is also a student at the University of California, Berkeley’s Haas School of Business, where he’s expected to graduate from in May 2023 with a Master of Business Administration. SK confirmed to Bustle that he started his final year at UC Berkeley in August 2022. “School is kicking my ass, there’s no other way to put it,” he said. “I’m in this very rigorous, full-time MBA program at Berkeley, and other than that, I’m also very involved on campus with student leadership things, and it’s been pretty intense for me juggling school and life, and every other thing that comes with it.”</p><p>In his interview with People, SK revealed that Raven was open to committing a long distance relationship with him while he lived in California and she lived in Texas, but he didn’t think that was enough.&nbsp;“In our very first conversation, I brought it up. I was like, ‘I’m actually getting ready to go to grad school in the fall.’ And she didn’t really have a problem with that,” he said. “We said we’re going to do things long distance and we’re going to try it out.” He continued, “But of course, it’s easier said than done… when things get real and now you have to put numbers on paper. Besides that, I’ve also had a very, very international life. I’ve lived in five countries to date, and I knew that sometime in the future, we could have a possibility of having to move somewhere else, maybe with kids even.” Still, SK told People that he understood why Raven didn’t want to move to California with him.&nbsp;“For me, it was a big deal because I knew that love should lead everywhere, wherever you’re going. I don’t think we had enough time to be able to get there,” he said. “And also, for her to trust me, right? It’s been 10 days since we’d known each other and telling someone that you just met in 10 days to leave their own dreams and come pursue your own dreams, it’s got to take a lot of gut to be able to do that. And I just don’t think we were there yet.”</p><p>Raven also confirmed in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">TV Insider</a> that SK moved to California just four days after their wedding. “I’ve always understood why he said no,” she said. “We had a lot of things working against us. SK literally moved probably four days after we wrapped filming to go to grad school across the country in a different timezone. Our cultural differences, huge. We started off really slow, which was our own thing. We had an incredible journey, but our whole thing was doing it on our own time, and unfortunately time just wasn’t on our side.” She continued, “We had a lot more logistical things to figure out inside of our relationship, so it’s not that I didn’t understand. It still hurt. I understood what was happening and I knew why, but I was just still emotional because I was super in love with him.”</p><p>Before he moved to California, SK previously lived in Dallas, Texas, where he worked as a Senior Data Engineer at JPMorgan Chase & Co. He started the job in 2019, two years before he filmed Love Is Blind season 3. <span>According to </span><a href=# rel=noopener>Variety</a><span>, </span>Love Is Blind<span> season 3 filmed immediately after </span>Love Is Blind<span> season 2, which was shot in Chicago, Illinois, wrapped in June 2021. </span>Love Is Blind<span> season 2 filmed for two months from April to June 2021, which means that </span>Love Is Blind<span> season 3 would’ve finished filming around September 2021, four months before SK took his job at UC Launch. Still, SK and Raven seem to be on good terms at least. In a post on her Instagram Story in October 2022, Raven shared a screenshot from Love Is Blind season 3 of her instructing SK in pilates with the caption, “he did so good tho.”</span></p><p>SK also told <a href=# id=auto-tag_tv data-tag=tv>TV</a> Insider that he didn’t have regrets over telling Raven “I do not” at the altar. “I don’t think I have any regrets currently about my decision on that day,” he said. “I didn’t feel like I had gotten enough to be able to move forward with that step. Me proposing to her was me getting the opportunity to do that in the real world, and when we got back to Dallas, the real world came at us really quickly. We had a lot of other things to resolve that were still outstanding, and it just wasn’t enough for me to overlook and say ‘yes’ just because we’re at the altar and it was time to go.” He continued, “However, I feel really bad watching it all over again. Watching her cry and [seeing] how heartbroken she was, as well as my family present. Watching my mom in that situation was very difficult for me.”</p><p>SK also revealed to TV Insider that if he could change anything about himself on Love Is Blind season 3, it’s that he would be “more vulnerable.” “I don’t really think I have something to change. I feel like throughout the process I was myself. I was genuine, and I let myself be vulnerable. If I could do anything differently, it would probably be even more vulnerable in the process,” he said.</p><h2>Who is Raven from Love Is Blind season 3?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Raven_Ross_Love-Is-Blind-Season-3.jpg><p>Who is Raven from Love Is Blind season 3?

Love Is Blind season 1 was filmed in Atlanta, Georgia, while season 2 was filmed in Chicago, Illinois. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Entertainment Tonight</a> in 2020, Love Is Blind creator Chris Coelen explained that each season casts contestants from the same city so long distance isn’t a factor in their relationships. “It was a really interesting and diverse cast in terms of the fact that they were all from many different places originally,” he said. “But they were all living around the Atlanta area [at the time of casting]. The reason that we did that was because we wanted to give these people a real shot at making their relationships work for the long term.”</p><p>He continued, “Whether you think [love] is going to happen or not, we wanted people that would be ready to be married. If you’re really in it—genuinely in it, which was the No. 1 casting criteria—it felt to us that it was too much of a bridge for someone living in Miami and someone living in Seattle to build. We thought let’s at least start with them in the same geographical area.”</p><p>Coelen also explained to <a href=# rel=noopener>Variety</a> in 2020 about why he wanted each Love Is Blind season to cast contestants from the same city. “We wanted people to all be living, currently in the same place. It’s too difficult if you’re from Tampa and they’re from Portland, that just throws another wrench in. We wanted to give them a real shot at making their love and their marriage working,” he said. Coelen also told Variety at the time about the locations he was looking at for future Love Is Blind seasons. “Look, the idea is that ultimately we’re going to do this in other countries—it’s very global. There’s lots of places that that we could take it. Chicago is a great place to look at, so is New York, Boston, Houston. There’s so many different places that we could go. And like I said, outside of the country as well,” he said.</p><p>Coelen also told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Oprah</a> magazine in 2020 that The Pods lasted around 10 days, which started with a series of speed dates between contestants that lasted between eight to 12 minutes. We did a ranking system, from who you though was most compatible to least compatible after the first date. Every day, the list got shorter and shorter,” Love Is Blind season 1 contestant Mark Cuevas told Oprah magazine at the time. Coelen also told Oprah magazine made the cast smaller a few days into the The Pods stage to focus on the contestants forming “real connections.” “We ended up focusing on people who were really forming real connections,” he said.</p><p>Though the dates started short, Coelen told Variety that the producers allowed contestants to have longer dates once they saw how strong their connections were. “In the beginning nobody knew who anybody was. So we structured it so that they would have an opportunity to talk to everyone. They were never given any instruction on what to say or what not to say or what they could ask about or what they couldn’t ask about. And you see on the show, some people decided to [ask] ‘How tall are you, what do you look like?'” he said. “Other people were like, ‘Why would I ever do that? That’s not the point of this.’ We really wanted it to be their own story, their own journey. We would set it up so they had the opportunity to talk to everybody. Then from that point [it was monitored]. Let’s say somebody really wanted to talk to you and you’re like, ‘Yeah, I have no interest in that person.'”</p><p>He continued, “You’re not going to talk to them. It doesn’t matter. We’re not going to arrange people to speak to one another where somebody’s like, ‘yeah, I don’t want to talk to that person.’ We just wouldn’t do that. Multiple points throughout the day we had to break and they had to eat, go to the bathroom, go do interviews, but generally we wanted to give them as much time in the pods as possible with the people that they genuinely wanted to talk to. These dates are obviously cut down but they were hours and hours and hours long.”</p><h2>Who are the Love Is Blind season 3 hosts?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Nick-Vanessa-Lachey-Love-Is-Blind.png><p>The Love Is Blind season 3 hosts are Nick Lachey and Vanessa Lachey, who have hosted the series since it premiered in February 2020. The couple also hosted season 1 of Netflix’s The Ultimatum. Nick was the lead singer of the boy band 98 Degrees from 1996 to 2012. The group reunited in 2012 and are still together. Nick has also released four solo alums: SoulO, What’s Left of Me, A Father’s Lullaby and Soundtrack of My Life. He was married to Jessica Simpson from 2002 to 2006, and the two also starred in their own reality show, Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica on MTV, from 2003 to 2005. Nick is also the winner of season 5 of The Masked Singer&nbsp;during which he performed as the character “Piglet.” Vanessa was the 1998 Miss Teen USA and was a correspondent for Entertainment Tonight and Total Request Live on MTV. She’s the current lead in CBS’ NCIS spinoff, NCIS: Hawai’i, which premiered in 2021.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Distractify</a> in March 2022, Nick explained that he and Vanessa wanted to host Love Is Blind because of how their own relationship was long distance when they first started dating. “When Netflix approached us with Love is Blind all those years ago, we jumped at the opportunity because the show really spoke to us personally,” Nick said. “When we first started dating, Vanessa was in New York and I was in Los Angeles. We didn’t get to see each other a lot so we had a lot of long phone conversations, learning everything we possibly could about each other.” He continued, “[Those conversations were] really important for building our relationship and knowing we wanted the same things before there were external pressures on the relationship.” Nick also told Distractify that he and Vanessa want contestants to “fall in love for the right reasons and then introduce everything else.”</p><p>Nick also told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> in 2022 about how he thinks Love Is Blind would’ve worked for him and Vanessa if they had met in The Pods.&nbsp;“We’ve thought about that, often. And I really, I’m not just saying this for the benefit of this show, I think we would’ve,” he said. “We have the same birthday, we have the same passions, we have the same interests, we have the same drive. Things that motivated us.” Vanessa asked “You would’ve found me through a wall?” to which Nick responded, “I would find you anywhere.” He continued, “I really do think we would’ve found each other. I think we would’ve gravitated to each other. That’s what we did in life. Obviously, we knew each other.” Vanessa added, “We did. We had to find our journey to get to each other.”</p><p>Nick also claimed to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Us <span>Weekly</span></a><span>&nbsp;in 2022 that he would’ve joined Love Is Blind if he was single. “I would. I mean, it’s fascinating,” he said. “Especially having seen the success of season 1 and seeing two loving couples still married to this day? If I watched that and I was looking for love, why wouldn’t you wanna be a part of that? You know, it’s proven to work!” He added, </span>“This dating world is not one I ever was part of — this very superficial ‘swipe left.’ There’s so much judgment and you can Google everybody. I’m not from that era.”</p><p>Love Is Blind season 3 is available to stream on Netflix.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Leap-of-Faith-Cameron-Hamilton-Lauren-Speed.jpeg><p><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-price data-transform data-truncate>$15.89</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias=buy-now__original-price data-alignment data-theme=product-price-strikethrough data-transform data-truncate>$28.00</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-percentage-off data-transform data-truncate>43% Off</span></p><p><span class=s1>For more about Love Is Blind, read Cameron Hamilton and Lauren Speed’s 2021 book,<a href=# rel=nofollow><span class=s2><i> Leap of Faith: Finding Love the Modern Way</i></span></a></span><span class=s3><i>. </i></span><span class=s1>In the book, Cameron and Lauren, who were one of two couples to marry from <i>Love Is Blind</i> season 1, share their “engaging and accessible love advice for the modern world” and reveal exclusive behind-the-scenes details from the Netflix series and what went down in The Pods that viewers didn’t see.
