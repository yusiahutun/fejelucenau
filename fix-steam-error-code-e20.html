Does your app display an "e20" error code? If so, you aren’t alone. Many users have experienced this error message, preventing them from signing in to their account in the app. Luckily, there are a few ways to resolve this problem, and we’ll show you those ways.</p><h2 id=why-do-you-get-a-steam-error-code-e20>Why Do You Get a Steam Error Code e20?</h2><p><a href=#>Steam’s error</a> code e20 appears when your sign-in in the app fails. This happens for various reasons, but the app doesn’t tell you exactly what has caused the issue. User reports indicate the issue occurs when Steam can’t connect to its servers, which can happen for many reasons.</p><p>It’s possible your internet connection isn’t working, or Steam’s servers are down. These issues can cause your Steam sign-in to fail, leading to the above error. Let's look at how to fix the issue so you can get back to gaming.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-to-fix-a-steam-error-code-e20>How to Fix a Steam Error Code e20</h2><p>To <a href=#>resolve an error code e20 in Steam</a>, you’ll have to fix the items that may be causing Steam not to connect to its servers. Once you’ve rectified the issues with these items, Steam will connect to its servers, allowing you to log in to your account and access your app features.</p><p>Here are a few methods you can use on your computer.</p><h3 id=fix-your-internet-connection-issues>Fix Your Internet Connection Issues</h3><p>The most likely reason you can’t log in to Steam and get an error e20 is that your internet connection has stopped working. This causes Steam to be unable to authenticate your logins, leading to the above error message. This one is naturally the easiest to diagnose as you'll likely notice the broad problem (no internet access) almost immediately.</p><p>Still, you can double-check by launching your preferred web browser and opening a site. If your site won’t load, your connection is faulty. In this case, use various methods, like <a href=#>rebooting your router</a>, <a href=#>fixing your network adapter</a>, and using many <a href=#>other internet troubleshooting tips</a>, to resolve your problem.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=check-if-steam-is-down>Check If Steam Is Down</h3><p>If Steam’s servers are down, that can cause your log-in not to go through, leading to an e20 error. Steam’s servers can go down for many reasons, including sudden issues or scheduled maintenance on the platform’s end.</p><p>To check if Steam is down, head to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">unofficial Steam Status</a> or <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Downdetector</a> site. These sites collect downtime reports from users and tell you if a platform is experiencing an outage.</p><p>If those sites say that Steam is down, wait until the company has fixed the server problems. Once that’s done, you can log in to your account in the app.</p><h3 id=restart-your-computer>Restart Your Computer</h3><p>If your Steam error e20 persists, your computer’s operating system might have an issue. Such system problems sometimes cause your installed apps to malfunction, leading to many issues.</p><p>Luckily, you can <a href=#>resolve many minor issues with your system by rebooting your computer</a>. This is an easy and effective way to get rid of many glitches on your computer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To <a href=#>restart your Windows 11 or Windows 10 PC</a>, open the Start Menu, click the Power icon, and select "Restart."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1-restart-windows-pc.png><p>Wait for your computer to turn off and back on, then launch Steam and try to sign in to your account.</p><h3 id=turn-off-your-firewall>Turn Off Your Firewall</h3><p>Your computer’s firewall manages your incoming and outgoing connections to keep your machine safe. It’s possible this tool has detected your Steam app as a potential threat, blocking the app’s access to its servers. In this case, Steam can’t authorize your login, leading to an error message.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To fix that, temporarily <a href=#>turn off your computer’s firewall</a>. Do that by launching the Windows Security app on your PC, selecting "Firewall & Network Protection," choosing the network that says "(active)," and disabling the "Microsoft Defender Firewall" toggle. Then, in the "User Account Control" prompt, select "Yes."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2-turn-off-microsoft-defender-firewall.png><p>After you’ve disabled your firewall, launch Steam and see if the app can log you in. If it works, <a href=#>add Steam to your firewall’s whitelist</a> so you don’t face the above issue again.</p><h3 id=enable-or-disable-your-vpn>Enable or Disable Your VPN</h3><p>One possible reason Steam’s connection with its servers fails is that Steam has restricted your computer’s IP address. This usually happens when the platform finds spammy activities from your IP.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To confirm that, change your computer’s public IP address by using a <a href=#>free VPN</a> or <a href=#>paid VPN</a> app. Such an app gives you a new IP address, helping you bypass your online platforms’ restrictions.</p><p>If you’re already using a VPN, <a href=#>your VPN’s IP address might be banned</a>. In this case, turn off your VPN and see if you can use Steam. If it works, change your location in your VPN or get another VPN app that Steam hasn’t restricted.</p><h3 id=clear-your-steam-cache>Clear Your Steam Cache</h3><p>If your Steam error e20 still isn’t fixed, it’s possible your app’s cache files are corrupted. Such cache corruption can cause login problems as well as a plethora of other issues.</p><p>Fortunately, fixing a bad cache is easy, as all you have to do is <a href=#>clear the current cache files</a>. This doesn’t affect the data saved in your Steam app.</p><p>To do that, open your PC’s Run dialog box by pressing Windows+R. In the box, type the following path and press Enter:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><pre>%localappdata%\steam\htmlcache</pre><p>In the open folder, select all files by pressing Ctrl+A. Then, delete all files by right-clicking a selected file and choosing "Delete" (a trash can icon).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/3-delete-steam-cache-files.png><p>After clearing your Steam cache, launch the Steam app and try to sign in to your account.</p><p>We hope the guide above helps you resolve your Steam login e20 error so you can access your account and all your games in the app. Happy gaming!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGidorBdqMGmrcxmnKuqn6d6pLvDnmSeamBk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
