We can't get over the interior of the bakery - it's so beautiful thanks to its hand-painted depictions of fantastical birds and in a style reminiscent of the exotic fin-de-siécle tea-house. The decor is clearly designed as much to delight the eye as to satisfy our appetites! The team here have devised a special selection of breads, cakes and viennoiseries for the new shop.&nbsp;</p><p id=ecP3I7Zqtd data-wc=107>Their recipes, some of which have taken as long as five years to be brought to perfection, are a more contemporary twist on the classics once found in those much-missed boulangerie-pâtisseries. All the bread and cakes at the bakery are made from exceptional ingredients, sourced from around the globe: the wheat flour comes from an artisanal farmer in Burgundy, the sea salt from La Guérande in Brittany, the plump almonds from Valencia, and the thick dark honey from hives in Bermondsey. A special reserve of bitter chocolate, created specifically for Birley, and mixed with cacao beans from the Philippines, forms the basis of the range of chocolates.</p><p id=eidL4eQZdXU data-wc=2>Visit, <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>birleybakery.com</a></p><p id=exg43Fa9eiB data-wc=7><strong>Revi</strong><strong>ewed by <a class=hm-link href=#>Sharnaz Shahid</a>, Deputy Online Editor</strong></p><h2>Charles Artisan Bread</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8eef60e860af-charles-bakery-z.jpg><p id=exfJBtL2Q27- data-wc=56>Charles Artisan Bread is a small micro-bakery in Clapton, providing simple, honest and no-fuss freshly baked goods every day.
