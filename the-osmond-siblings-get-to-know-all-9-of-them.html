And “a few” is probably an understatement as Donny and Marie have seven other famous brothers!</p><p>Donny and Marie, as well as their siblings <strong>Virl Osmond</strong>, <strong>Tom Osmond</strong>, <a href=#><strong>Alan Osmond</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Merrill Osmond</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Wayne Osmond</strong></a>, <strong>Jay Osmond</strong> and <a href=#><strong>Jimmy Osmond</strong></a>, were all raised by parents <a href=#>Olive Osmond</a> and <a href=#>George Osmond</a>. The proud mom and dad were married in 1944 and remained a pair until <a href=#>Olive’s death in 2004</a>. <a href=#>George sadly died just three years later in 2007</a>.</p><p>As fans of the iconic Osmond clan know, Donny and Marie reached mainstream fame with their 1976 variety series <a href=#>Donny & Marie</a>, but they weren’t the only ones in the family that went the music route.</p><p>In fact, way before Donny had a hit TV show, he joined the barbershop quartet known as The Osmond Brothers, which also included his brothers Alan, Merrill, Wayne, Jay and Jimmy.</p><p>Although the Osmond siblings went their separates ways in their careers as they got older, the beloved brood stayed closer than ever. Marie’s brothers even <a href=#>praised her for being such an amazing sister</a> while growing up alongside seven boys.</p><p>“I think the greatest compliment I can give my sister is that she’s so much like our mother. She’s not only a wonderful wife but she’s a great mother to her kids and a wonderful grandmother,” Jay gushed in video tribute in honor of <a href=#>Marie’s 60th birthday on&nbsp;</a><a href=#>The Talk</a>&nbsp;in October 2019.</p><p>Alan echoed his brother’s sentiments, marveling, “She cares and loves others. She’s always giving to others before giving to herself.” He sweetly added, “She brought in a sense of class and beauty to our family and she is the jewel on top of the tree.”</p><p>The beloved TV host proved she loves her brothers just as much as she once shared a sweet throwback of their family <a href=#>in honor of National Siblings Day</a>. “To my eight amazing brothers, Happy #NationalSiblingsDay!” Marie <a href=#>captioned a snap via Instagram</a>, adding the hashtag “#FamiliesAreForever.”</p><p><strong>Scroll down to learn about each of the Osmond siblings!&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46tn55ln6i6sLrDZqqimpyeu6i%2FjKCcrWWkpHqsus6wZJqknGKGbrvFZquhnZ1k</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
