The English Football Leagues are broken down in the following order:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Premiere League&nbsp;</li><li>Championship League</li><li>League One</li><li>League Two&nbsp;</li><li>National League</li></ul><p id=par-7_34>Below the National League are the National Leagues North and South. After these leagues come the four regional leagues: Northern Premiere League, Southern League Central Division and South Division, and Isthmian League Premiere Division.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_35>Each league promotes and relegates a certain number of teams each season. In the National League, four teams fall into relegation, which means they fall into the league below, at the end of the season.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-9_30>On the other hand, two teams from the National League receive a promotion to the league above.
