Returning to NBA in 2014, he penned a lucrative multi-year contract with Atlanta Hawks.</p><p style=text-align:justify>In June 2016, the Hawks exercised a $1.02 million option on his contract. A year later, he penned a 2-year-long deal worth $10 million. Per the agreement, the Hawks had to pay him&nbsp;$5 million annually in salary. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Another NBA Athlete In Our Vault:-&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=follow>Who Is Rodney Hood Girlfriend Turned Wife & What Is Salary?

However, by the end of the campaign, his name got heavily linked with Oklahoma Thunders.</p><p style=text-align:justify>While the&nbsp;news turned heads,&nbsp;details about&nbsp;Mike's alleged contract with the Thunders didn't become public.

However, it didn't prove useful&nbsp;enough. So in February 2019, the 76ers traded him to Los Angeles Clippers. Clippers, in turn, shipped him to rivals Los Angeles Lakers. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify>Less than six months into his tenure at the Lakers, Mike reportedly was again on the move.

As a result, his name is yet to get riled up in controversy.

It even prompted an apology from Mike and his team. But, undoubtedly, the whole debacle was a cause of shame for his mother, Mary Madia. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>Talking about his siblings, Mike has a sister named Madeline Madia.
