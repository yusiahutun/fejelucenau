While the cancer had taken a toll, he died in his own home, in his own bed, with dignity, and surrounded by love. He was 56 years old.</p><p>In lieu of flowers, it is requested that donations be made to the <a href=#>Prostate Cancer Foundation</a> in Dave Kirby’s name. To share memories of Dave Kirby, please visit <a href=#>1000 Memories</a>. A memorial is planned for late October, with details to be forthcoming.</p><p>TKO will continue to flourish as a company as not only a legacy to Dave Kirby, but also as a tribute to his dedication and devotion to his employees and bands. The structure of the company will remain the same as it has since Dave appointed new titles and responsibilities more than a year ago:</p><p><br><b>Mike Monterulo</b> – Chief Executive Officer (CEO)<br><b>Andrew Goodfriend</b> – President<br><b>Dan DeVita</b> – Sr. Vice President<br><b>Rika O’Connor-Gargano</b> – Chief Operating Officer (COO)<br><b>Michael Ullman</b> – Chief Financial Officer (CFO)</p><p>“Although we are very sad to lose a mentor, friend and family member, Dave made it very clear to us upon his diagnosis that he wanted TKO to thrive in his absence,” said Monterulo. “The company will not only thrive, but also grow, expanding its reach and continuing to further define our place as one of the music industry’s most respected boutique agencies.”</p><p>Since its inception in September 2005, TKO has grown into one of the music industry’s premier booking agencies, and was nominated for a myriad of industry awards. With a roster of more than 100 artists, the company’s clients include Buckcherry, Papa Roach, Motorhead, Anthrax, Hellyeah, Mudvayne, The Cult, Ray Manzarek and Robbie Krieger of the Doors, and Hank III.</p><p>“The one thing that Dave Kirby always instilled in us was to believe in the bands we work with, respect their music, and encourage their development,” said Goodfriend. “That is the foundation that this company is built on, and that is the foundation that this company will continue to build upon in the years to come.” –by CelebrityAccess Staff Writers</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaJuRlr%2BktMivnGickauybrfIq5myZZakwq%2BwxKuaoZmZp7qiuoyonWasm6R6o7vOpKCnn12WtKa6wrJknaGVqHqiwIxubWg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
