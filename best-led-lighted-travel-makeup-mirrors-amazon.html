Fancii LED Lighted Travel Makeup Mirror</h2><p><span>With a beautiful case, you’ll love slipping this mirror into your bag. This mirror endeavors to give you the most accurate view of yourself—for better or worse. It has daytime LED, so it reflects natural sunlight back at you with the correct colors. Then you can for sure see if that red lipstick is too harsh. It might look like a small compact in the photos, but this baby gives a 5-in. large view. One mirror is just a regular mirror, while the other mirror gives you 10X the magnification. The LED bulbs will last up to 20,000 hours.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/fancii-makeup-mirror-amazon-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41EAIfEMyZL._SL500_.jpg><h2>2. KOOLORBS 10X Magnifying Makeup Mirror</h2><p><span>If you’re going to a special event while traveling and know you’ll want a larger mirror to look into, check out this pick. It weighs less than 1 lb. and can easily fit into your suitcase. This mirror is also equipped with a suction cup on the bottom, which allows you to place it flat or even wall- or mirror-mount it. You can get a closer look when you’re tweezing your eyebrows or applying lipstick. It has 10X magnification and three adjustable color lighting and brightness. It takes three AAA batteries, which you’ll need to buy.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/koolorbs-makeup-mirror-amazon.jpg><h2 class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-title-lg data-transform data-truncate>KOOLORBS 10X Magnifying Makeup Mirror</h2><h2>3. KEDSUM 1X/10X Double Sided LED Lighted Makeup Mirror</h2><p><span>This compact packs quite the punch. Even though it’s small enough to put in your purse, you’ll get a clear look at your face. There are two mirrors, one normal mirror and 10X magnification. You can choose to turn the LED lights on the top mirror, the bottom mirror or both. The best part about this compact is that you can fold it to make a mini-raised vanity, thanks to the bracket underneath. The seller claims that the LED lights will never run out or fade.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/kedsum-led-mirror-amazon.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41tnh0iY8NL._SL500_.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLqit8Sup2hpYWl9dn%2BQaJmeq6RiuaawjKWgoKCkmrFuwNGarZ6kXaKurLHUqWSmoaKnvLO%2FjJqkmrKfo3w%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
