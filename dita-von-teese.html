But does she ever get sick of the self-made uniform?</p><p>“Sometimes I fantasize about having blonde hair again or red hair,” says Dita. “But I never get sick of the red lipstick.”</p><p>I’m obviously not alone in my fascination with the burlesque star. Her line of lingerie and two fragrances are launching on <strong>HSN.com</strong> April 23rd. After seeing the 1930s-inspired bottle for her eponymous perfume, I had to know the inspiration behind the <a href=#>seductive scent</a>.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static-dailymakeover.stylecaster.com/2013/03/163187773.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/gucci-beauty.png><p>“I was going through this funny thing that happened,” says Dita. “I was dating somebody new, and he confessed that the perfume that I wore, that I’d been wearing my whole life, basically, was the same perfume his mother wore.&nbsp;When it happened I called my friend <strong>Kilian Hennessy</strong>, who’s a really great perfumer, and I said ‘Well I don’t know what to do. His mother wears the same perfume.’&nbsp;He said, ‘It’s not possible. You get rid of the man or you get rid of the perfume. There’s no other option.’ &nbsp;<span>So when I was approached to make my own, I went in, and I was intent on creating my own new signature scent to replace that.”</span></p><p><span>Dita’s new signature scent opens with fresh bergamot, peony and Bourbon pepper but quickly transitions into a warmer base of patchouli, musk, guaiac wood and sandalwood. As a young girl, though, Dita gravitated toward the popular&nbsp;Love’s Baby Soft, and later, her mother’s bottle of Halston.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Soon, Dita’s ventures may expand into cosmetics. She already has a limited-edition line of red lipsticks with <strong>Art Deco</strong>, but unfortunately for me, they’re only available in Europe. So, what about those of us in the US? “I’m working on a new project. I definitely always want to be creating lipsticks, because it’s something that I love to do. It’s just a matter of getting the right collaboration.” In the meantime, Dita says her favorite reds are <strong>MAC’s Ruby Woo</strong>&nbsp;($15, <a href=# rel=nofollow>macys.com</a>) and <strong>Dior’s </strong>discontinued<strong> Dolce Vita Red</strong>.</p><p>What I really wanted to know was how to get flawless skin like Dita’s. “<span>I use a light retinol at night a few times a week. I use sunscreen diligently. I’m pretty basic when it comes to my skin care. I don’t feel like there’s any miracle products that I use.” Well, that’s disheartening, but it’s nice to hear a celebrity be honest about their naturally good genes.</span></p><p>Do you love Dita’s look as much as I do?</p><p><a href=#>Read more:&nbsp;<strong>Celebs Who May (Or May Not) Have Had Nose Jobs</strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLqit8Sup2htZ2mBcXyOnaCtmV2rvK95056crJ1f</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
