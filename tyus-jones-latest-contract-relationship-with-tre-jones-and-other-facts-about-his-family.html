After starting his career with the Minnesota Timberwolves, many believed that the point guard would make the team a star for a long time to come. Recently, however, he made a rather shocking move to Memphis Grizzlies. Here’s a quick look at the details of the last dotted lines he signed, his previous signatures, and information about his family.</p><h2><strong>Career Signings and Current Contract&nbsp;</strong><strong>Details&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>After leading Duke University to their NCAA Division 1 title in 2015 and being crowned MVP of the final, he decided to give a shot at the NBA Draft where he was selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers as the 24th overall.</p><p>However, he was unable to play for the team because they sold him to the Minnesota Timberwolves and he signed his rookie contract with them. He stayed with the team until 2019 and then moved back to Memphis to play for the Memphis Grizzlies. This move was made because the Timberwolves were not willing to fulfill the grizzlys’ offer to play for the point guard.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Blake Shelton’s Wives, Kids, Girlfriend, And Brother</a></strong></p><p>According to the last contract he signed, Tyus Jones remains committed to the team for three years worth $26,445,300. He has a guaranteed payment of $23,895,300.</p><p>In the first year of the contract, his salary is $8,408,000 and incentives of $850,000. Interestingly, the contract has a cap of $9,258,000. In the second and third years of the contract, Jones will take home $7,965,100 and $7,522,200 in annual base salary and incentives of $850,000 per year. The dead cap value of the two years is $7,965,100 and $8,000,000 respectively.</p><h2><strong>Details of Tyus Jones Contract With Minnesota Timberwolves</strong></h2><p>The first contract Tyus Jones signed was his aforementioned entry-level contract with Minnesota Timberwolves in 2015, which was valued at $6,537,195 for a 4-year contract. In the first year, 2015, he took home a salary of $1,282,080, while it increased to $1,339,680 in the second year. In the third year, he took home a salary of $1,471,382 and then $2,444,053 in his final season. The next contract offered to him by the team was less than what the Grizzles put on the table for him, so he decided to switch.</p><h2><strong>Here’s Everything to Know About His Family</strong></h2><p><strong>His family has basketball in their blood.</strong></p><p>Born as Tyus Robert Jones on May 10, 1996, in Apple Valley, basketball is something that seems to be part of his family’s gene. He started playing early on, following in the footsteps of his parents, Debbie and Robert Jones, who both played the sport in their youth. While Deb played as a point guard when she was at Devils Lake High School, Rob, who stands at a massive six feet, also played college level. In the 1980s, he represented the University of Wisconsin-Parkside in Division III.</p><p><strong>Debbie Jones is his main influence</strong></p><p>Since both his parents were involved in basketball, it is his mother, who is the main person for him, who influenced his love for this sport. She became his first and earliest coach when he was a child.</p><p><strong>His mother has battled Cancer</strong></p><p>In January 2019, Tyus and his entire family were in a sudden shock after Debbie was diagnosed with breast cancer. At first, she decided that it was best not to tell her sons what she was suffering from. However, the doctors advised her to tell them so that they could all face the disease as a family. 10 months later, with the support of Tyus and his siblings, whom she called her doctors, Debbie got the disease under control as she was later declared cancer-free.</p><p><strong>Tyus Jones has two brothers</strong></p><p>The Grizzlies Point Guard was raised as the second of three children. Both his older and younger brothers – Jadee Jones and Tre Jones – have also been involved in basketball. Jadee played until college level before he quit, while Tre is currently playing college basketball for the Duke Blue Devils. Tyus is also said to have a half-brother named Reggie Bunch, who was an NAIA All-American with Robert Morris in 2010.</p><p><strong>His parents got divorced</strong></p><p>The marriage between Jones’ parents didn’t last forever because they later divorced. The reason for the divorce or even when it took place is not known.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Jean Smart Husband, Age, Net worth, Daughter, Children, Wiki, Bio</a></strong></p><h2><strong>Is Tyus Jones married?</strong></h2><p>Tyus Jones is not yet married, but he definitely has a woman in his life. Even though he is one of those people who want to keep his private life largely private and media-free, he has made it clear via social media that he is not single. He is in a relationship with a woman named Carrie. The two are already engaged and expecting their first child.</p><p>The athlete used to be with Alyssa Goehner, his childhood sweetheart. Alyssa played volleyball for Lakeville High School and later for the University of Minnesota. They dated until the time Tyus was at Duke.</p><h2><strong>Is he related to Tre Jones?</strong></h2><p>With the potential that Tre Jones is currently showing at Duke, many people have asked what the relationship between the two players is like. As mentioned earlier, the two Stars are brothers. Tre was born in 2000, which means he is four years younger than Tyus.</p><p>Apart from the fact that they are siblings, they are also very close and have always been very supportive of each other. All signs indicate that Tre could end up in the NBA just like his older brother unless he decides to drop out like Jadee, the oldest of the three boys</p><figure id=attachment_33375 class="wp-caption alignnone" aria-describedby=caption-attachment-33375></figure><figure id=attachment_33379 class="wp-caption alignnone" aria-describedby=caption-attachment-33379></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51kwbrB0mahqKaVqHqtrdOeqq1lk6S7tb7AnKtmqpWhrrW1zqeqoaGgYsSqwMdmq6udXZ%2B8r7HSZpinnF2kwamx0WadmpukqHqirs6uq2agmah6p63MoqOyZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
