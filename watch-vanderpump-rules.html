The series — which started as a spin-off of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills in 2013 — was nominated for its first Primetime Emmy Award in the Unstructured Reality Program category in 2023.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>The nomination came after <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/tv-movies/1076631/vanderpump-rules-cast-salary/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Vanderpump Rules Season 10</a>‘s shocking scandal involving cast members Ariana Madix, Tom Sandoval, and Raquel Leviss.

It really is going back in time, and it really is me in a very different place than I’m at right now,” she said. “There’s good days and there’s bad days. There’s ups and there’s downs. There’s definitely going to be those moments—the dancing, having-fun feeling like, I got this. And then there’s going to be moments where maybe I don’t got this.

Vanderpump Rules Season 11 also marks the return of cast member Scheana Shay’s husband Brock Davies as a main cast member.

That’s against the law, right?” she said. “I’ve been out of the house since September. But obviously, there’s a loss. I’m trying to have the house sold because there’s been no movement, and I need to be able to get my investment so that I can move on with my life. It’s money. I need my money. I need it.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=why-isn-t-raquel-in-vanderpump-rules-season-11>Why isn’t Raquel in Vanderpump Rules Season 11?</h2><p>Why isn’t Raquel in Vanderpump Rules Season 11? Raquel joined Vanderpump Rules as a Guest in Season 5 before she became a recurring cast member from Seasons 6 to 8 while dating cast member James Kennedy. Raquel was a main cast member on Vanderpump Rules from Seasons 9 to 10. She broke up with James after Season 9 and had an affair with cast member Tom Sandoval — who was dating cast member Ariana Madix at the time — in Season 10. The affair — which was nicknamed #Scandoval — led to Vanderpump Rules‘ highest-ratings of all time. So why isn’t Raquel in Vanderpump Rules Season 11?</p><p>News broke in August 2023 that Raquel, whose real name is Rachel, would not be returning to Vanderpump Rules Season 11 to focus on her mental health. “Rachel will not be returning for season 11 of Vanderpump Rules. There was a possibility up until recently she’d be returning for the new season, but ultimately decided against it,” a source told <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.etonline.com/rachel-leviss-is-not-returning-to-vanderpump-rules-for-season-11-exclusive-208789 rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Entertainment Tonight</a> at the time. “Rachel is focused on her mental health journey and knew going back to the show would open her up to trauma she’s been working on healing. Rachel is looking forward to what the future holds for her.”</p><p>A source previously told Entertainment Tonight that Rachel was recovering with her family in Arizona after leaving a mental health facility. “Rachel has been spending time with her family in Arizona since leaving the mental health facility. Rachel has been receiving letters from people opening up about their own mental health journey and applauding her for taking time away from filming to focus on her mental health,” the source said. “Rachel is in a really good place and has been enjoying a slower pace of life. She’s been doing Pilates and often goes hiking.”</p><p>Vanderpump Rules producer Sheonna Mix revealed at a panel at BravoCon 2023 that she believed Raquel should have returned for Vanderpump Rules Season 11. “I don’t want to say it was a mistake because she made the decision that was good for her at that time,” Mix said. “But I do believe that she had more story to tell as you guys all salivated over that last 5 minutes. Like, there’s more to that. And I think if she would have came back, it would have been more rewarding for her, and she would be able to look at herself better.”</p><p>In an interview with Real Housewives of New York City alum Bethenny Frankel’s “Just B” podcast in August 2023, Raquel explained why she had an affair with Sandoval. “I know I would not be involved in this affair secrecy type of situation if I thought that there was longevity in this relationship between Tom and Ariana,” she said. “The people closest to them could see that their relationship hasn’t been what they portray on camera, and Tom always told me they’re a brand. They’re an image.”</p><p>After the interview, Raquel received backlash for seemingly blaming her affair on Ariana and Tom’s failing relationship. “To me, this is a weird thing to admit,” Instagram account Bravo Tea with Jared B said in an Instagram video at the time. “Because she’s saying she knew this wasn’t a real relationship or relationship that had legs, so that’s why she decided to participate in this affair . . . Whether real or not, formally, they were in a relationship despite the circumstances. If you wanted to be with Tom Sandoval so bad, you should have let him know that this tryst, this situation that was going on between you and him, goes no further until you know officially that they have broken up.”</p><p>Raquel, for her part, responded to the backlash in Jared’s Instagram comments. “💯 you’re not wrong! I should have had more self respect than that and should have respected the relationship that Ariana had with Tom,” she wrote. “No excuses… however, looking back, I see I had low self-worth and Tom kept telling me he was actively breaking up with her ‘amicably’ for her ‘mental health,’ which I can now see was magical thinking. He had a million and one reasons why they hadn’t broken up yet and it was easier to stay in that fantasy then to face the fact that the social anxiety and isolation was not worth it.”</p><p>She continued, So yes, absolutely you’re 100% right. It was MY responsibility to remove myself from that situation… now I know better ♥️.”</p><p>Vanderpump Rules airs on Tuesdays at 8 p.m. on Bravo.
