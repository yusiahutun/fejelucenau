"Up until that time, action was a car chase like 'Bullitt' or 'The French Connection.' A film all about intellect and innuendo and verbal this and verbal that."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:6d13972e-d842-44aa-9e15-136bfc93b73f data-container-ref=toofab:article:15348819-41b5-420b-a36d-b0aa29194789 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/90/5by4/2023/06/08/9067db6ca18a43dca4dc58b266794b17_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty / Everett</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Arnold Schwarzenegger Fought James Cameron Over Most Iconic Line -- And Lost</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>However, when the action landscape started to change, Stallone credits Schwarzenegger with defining the new genre.</p><p>"You actually relied upon your body to tell the story," continued Stallone. "Dialogue was not necessary. I saw that there was an opportunity, because no one else was doing this except some other guy from Austria, who doesn’t need to say much… He was superior. He just had all the answers. He had the body. He had the strength. That was his character."</p><p>Stallone also added that Schwarzenegger "never got hurt much," where as Stallone got his "ass kicked constantly."</p><p>"I'm going, 'Arnold, you could go out and fight a dragon and you’d come back with a Band-Aid.'"</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:5dd051b4-5fec-45d8-b28d-37e317869d7a data-container-ref=toofab:article:15348819-41b5-420b-a36d-b0aa29194789 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/2b/5by4/2023/05/23/2b50a6508c034812afe5c1beebf8b5bf_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Paramount+</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Sylvester Stallone Writes Breakup Texts For Daughters' Boyfriends</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Schwarzenegger also shared his praise for Stallone as well, particularly for motivating him to keep working harder in the genre.</p><p>"Every time he came out with a movie like 'Rambo II,' I had to figure out a way of now outdoing that," shared Schwarzenegger. "Without Stallone, I maybe wouldn't have been as motivated in the '80s to do the kind of movies that I did and to work as hard as I did. I’m a competitive person."</p><p>"Arnold" is now available to stream on Netflix.</p><a id=gallery-link-86e21a51-46e0-53de-b486-53d385ac42f7 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:86e21a51-46e0-53de-b486-53d385ac42f7 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:15348819-41b5-420b-a36d-b0aa29194789 data-gallery-layout=list><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/40/4by3/2023/06/09/40e2c8ac5fee4814843b6c2b7662a147_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="media-credit gallery-block__media-credit">Everett Collection/Getty</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j29mampfqMatwsSsq56qXajBorjLqKWeZZOWua2%2FjJqpp6ecmXq0r8ewmKuylaOyqLPEq2SsraCav6q70Wg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
