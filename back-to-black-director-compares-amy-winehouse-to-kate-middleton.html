The English singer-songwriter announced herself as a major talent with her debut album Frank in 2003 and her sophomore album Back To Black went on to become one of the best-selling albums in UK history after its release in 2006, also cementing her as an international icon. Before her tragic passing at the age of 27 in July 2011, her private life and struggles with addiction were widely publicized by the media, something that the new biopic <a href=#>movie</a> Back To Black doesn’t shy from exploring.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-back-to-black-director-compares-amy-winehouse-treatment-to-kate-middleton>Back To Black director compares Amy Winehouse treatment to Kate Middleton</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/04/GettyImages-1341738390-1024x736.jpg><p>The Amy Winehouse biopic Back To Black is directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson and stars Marisa Abela in the role of the singular singer.</p><p>Chronicling her musical passions from the early 2000s and her rise to stardom, the movie celebrates Amy for her spirit, personality, and talent, rather than merely focusing on the tragedy that so many now most closely associate with her.</p><p>Despite this, the media frenzy that surrounded her during later years is such a crucial part of Amy’s story.</p><p>Speaking with The Hollywood Reporter about the relationship between UK tabloids and Amy, Sam <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">argued</a> the excessive coverage shares parallel with the recent whirlwind media coverage surrounding <a href=#>Kate Middleton</a>‘s health, speculation having been rampant before she <a href=#>revealed her cancer diagnosis</a>.</p><p>“People just want more, more, more,” the filmmaker commented on the nature of media coverage of the two figures. “There’s a voracious appetite for needing every shred of information around somebody who’s so public.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-sam-taylor-johnson-is-no-stranger-to-how-it-feels>Sam Taylor-Johnson is no stranger to how it feels</h2><p>Sam was diagnosed with colon cancer at the age of 30 and shared her thoughts on how deeply affecting the experience was. “You are absolutely in a state of trauma and survival,” she explained. “All you really want to do is to cocoon yourself and your family. I felt pangs of anxiety around what she must be going through.”</p><p>The director who previously helmed the successful Fifty Shades Of Grey adaptation is also no stranger to intense media coverage, as she met her now-husband <a href=#>Aaron Taylor-Johnson</a> when he was 18, and she was 42.</p><p>“There are times where it’s uncomfortable,” she said of the spotlight on their marriage. “Most of the time we zone it out and stay pretty private. We tend to retreat. Kids and school runs keep you pretty grounded.”</p><p>She met the actor when he was cast in the central role of her 2009 film Nowhere Boy. The couple tied the knot in 2012 and now share two daughters, and Aaron’s also a stepfather to her two daughters from a previous marriage to art dealer Jay Jopling.</p><p>Back To Black opens in theaters on Friday, May 17th 2024.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlsX2Z%2BcK7AnKJmrJ9ir62twqRknaGimrC1u9FmmqiloJa%2Fpr%2BMmqSyZaeeu6a0zq6qnmWkpHqsrdOeZKahlJm5psDOp2Y%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
