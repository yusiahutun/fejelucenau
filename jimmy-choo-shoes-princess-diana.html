Visibly touched during the interview, he added: "She was a real princess. Down to earth, simple. Very nice, with a very good heart. She did a lot of charity, and left a good legacy."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/67307dc88169-princess-diana-wearing-catherine-walker-and-jimmy-choo-shoes-a.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=emMpf6XOVRoO data-wc=8><strong>Princess Diana wearing Jimmy Choos in June 1997</strong></p><p id=ewNvvIQVwWdi data-wc=103>Earlier this year in April, Jimmy, 68, sat down with <strong>HELLO! </strong>to talk about his most famous muse Diana, four months before her 20th death anniversary. "She was so easy to work with," said Jimmy in our exclusive video. "I think she was very kind. Every time I went to Kensington Palace she would offer me tea and coffee, some biscuits. I remember the last time, we were sitting on the floor together, looking at the designs of the shoes we were talking about. She would ask, 'How's your dad? How's your mum? How's your family? How's your daughter?' She was very kind.</p><p id=eYkjJjIk-q1e><a class=hm-link href=#>Micheal Kors buying Jimmy Choo</a></p><p id=eAXinQJWTmq2 data-wc=66>"She said, 'One day maybe I can be like you and design some shoes.' But she found it very hard to draw shoes, she said. After we were done she would help me pack up the shoes and always carried the bags with me. Lady Diana was helping me to carry the case to my car. Not just the first time, she would always do that."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
